Session-1,T,Okay so can you guys see,1,0,nan
Session-1,S,Yes,2,nan,0
Session-1,T,Yes your learning intention is you can multiply twodigit numbers by twodigit numbers,3,0,nan
Session-1,T,Were building up our skills two digits by two digits and were going to use partial product strategy,3,0,nan
Session-1,T,Well practice using the partitioned rectangles but then apply that practice doing partial products,3,0,nan
Session-1,T,Youll be successful if you can solve twodigit by twodigit numbers and you can match your partitioned rectangles to your partial products,3,0,nan
Session-1,T,Making sure that you can see how your answers should be the same,3,0,nan
Session-1,T,Okay,3,0,nan
Session-1,T,Youre mental math youre just doing quick extended facts,3,0,nan
Session-1,T,No youre not going to work and your math message is at the top of page 130 just problem one,4,0,nan
Session-1,T,Theres a partitioned rectangle problem followed by a partial products problem,4,0,nan
Session-1,T,Please go check your homework with a partner,4,1,nan
Session-1,T,Get started on mental math,4,0,nan
Session-1,T,Do problem one on page 130 and well get started in about eight minutes,4,0,nan
Session-1,T,Go,4,1,nan
Session-1,T,Why are you just automatically changing your answer,4,6,nan
Session-1,T,How do you know he is right,5,2,nan
Session-1,T,Talk about what steps you took to get there,6,5,nan
Session-1,T,Im sorry,6,0,nan
Session-1,T,If you werent,6,0,nan
Session-1,T,You guys should go ask someone else,7,0,nan
Session-1,T,Youre comparing,7,1,nan
Session-1,S,Yes,8,nan,0
Session-1,T,Start again,9,0,nan
Session-1,T,I have no idea what you just said,9,0,nan
Session-1,T,You said what,9,1,nan
Session-1,T,Yes but youre  Its just picking out different areas,10,0,nan
Session-1,T,You have about another minute and a half,10,0,nan
Session-1,S,Okay,11,nan,0
Session-1,T,30 more seconds,12,0,nan
Session-1,T,Both of those different problems,12,0,nan
Session-1,T,Show me on your fingers if you need more time,12,0,nan
Session-1,T,How many minutes do you need,12,0,nan
Session-1,T,Five is not going to happen,12,0,nan
Session-1,T,Two and three so Ill give about two and a half more,12,0,nan
Session-1,T,Hustle up,12,0,nan
Session-1,T,Okay,13,0,nan
Session-1,T,Times up,13,0,nan
Session-1,T,Lets see what you got two,13,0,nan
Session-1,T,All right who did pink problems,13,1,nan
Session-1,T,Okay so,13,0,nan
Session-1,T,4 times 50,13,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,14,nan,3
Session-1,T,30 times 7,15,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,16,nan,3
Session-1,T,70 times 8,17,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,18,nan,3
Session-1,S,nan,19,nan,1
Session-1,T,I hear you thinking,20,0,nan
Session-1,T,Basic facts with what,20,5,nan
Session-1,T,Yes,21,0,nan
Session-1,T,I heard it,21,0,nan
Session-1,T,I heard you say 56 and  thinking through,21,0,nan
Session-1,T,20 times 40,21,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,22,nan,3
Session-1,T,Why Clayton,23,6,nan
Session-1,T,Why not 80,23,6,nan
Session-1,S,Because 80 wouldnt work because theres 2 zeros added,24,nan,4
Session-1,T,Okay,25,0,nan
Session-1,T,Basic fact in there,25,0,nan
Session-1,T,Two extra zeros added in there,25,4,nan
Session-1,T,70 times 40,25,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,26,nan,3
Session-1,T,9 times 30,27,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,28,nan,3
Session-1,T,60 times 800,29,5,nan
Session-1,S,804 80000 48000,30,nan,3
Session-1,T,nan,31,3,nan
Session-1,T,Why 48000 and not 4800,31,6,nan
Session-1,T,Matt why not,31,6,nan
Session-1,S,Because there is 4 zeros,32,nan,4
Session-1,T,4 extra zeros to your basic fact,33,3,nan
Session-1,T,600 times 40,33,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,34,nan,3
Session-1,S,nan,35,nan,1
Session-1,S,nan,36,nan,1
Session-1,S,nan,37,nan,1
Session-1,T,I heard that 24000,38,0,nan
Session-1,T,900 times 9,38,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,39,nan,3
Session-1,S,nan,40,nan,1
Session-1,T,Oh I hear 8100,41,0,nan
Session-1,T,I hear 81 000 Whos correct,41,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,42,nan,3
Session-1,T,Why,43,6,nan
Session-1,T,Why is it not 81000,43,6,nan
Session-1,S,Because there is only 2 zeros,44,nan,4
Session-1,T,Two zeros,45,3,nan
Session-1,T,So if I write product for my basic fact David how many zeros should I add to the end of that,45,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,46,nan,3
Session-1,S,nan,47,nan,1
Session-1,T,Do you revise your thinking,48,1,nan
Session-1,T,Yes,48,0,nan
Session-1,S,nan,49,nan,3
Session-1,T,It was following a pattern and then it messed you up didnt it,50,1,nan
Session-1,S,Yes,51,nan,0
Session-1,T,All right,52,0,nan
Session-1,T,You may erase yes,52,0,nan
Session-1,T,Erase your whiteboard,52,0,nan
Session-1,T,Hi,52,0,nan
Session-1,T,On your math journal on the top two problems Thank you,52,0,nan
Session-1,T,Whats different from the problem that were looking at compared to what weve been doing,53,5,nan
Session-1,T,Jesse whats different about this problem,53,5,nan
Session-1,T,Its multiplication,53,0,nan
Session-1,T,Weve been working on multiplication all unit long so whats different about this,53,5,nan
Session-1,S,Were doing a twodigit number times a twodigit number,54,nan,3
Session-1,T,Were doing a twodigit number times a twodigit number,55,3,nan
Session-1,T,What have we been doing,55,5,nan
Session-1,T,A twodigit times a onedigit right,56,1,nan
Session-1,T,So its a little bit different,56,0,nan
Session-1,T,Let me make sure I have the right I dont think I have the right page,56,0,nan
Session-1,T,Thats not the right one,57,0,nan
Session-1,T,Yes thats not the right one,58,0,nan
Session-1,T,I was going to say This is not the right page,59,0,nan
Session-1,T,Thats so interesting that it has,59,0,nan
Session-1,S,Its page 130,60,nan,0
Session-1,T,Thank you,61,0,nan
Session-1,T,Theyre having to look back at that page and I think I copied the wrong one onto the screen,61,0,nan
Session-1,T,Sorry about that,61,0,nan
Session-1,T,Lets get the right page up,61,0,nan
Session-1,S,Yes,62,nan,0
Session-1,T,Its thinking,63,0,nan
Session-1,S,Think think think,64,nan,0
Session-1,T,Its really thinking and thinking and thinking,65,0,nan
Session-1,T,Well have to use the book,65,0,nan
Session-1,S,Okay,66,nan,0
Session-1,T,All right,67,0,nan
Session-1,T,Here is the correct page so when I ask us whats different about this problem it makes more sense now,67,0,nan
Session-1,T,Were doing twodigit numbers times twodigit numbers whereas before we were doing twodigit numbers times a onedigit number,67,0,nan
Session-1,T,All right someone who has theirs drawn and feels pretty confident about their work the way they worked that problem with a partition rectangle raise your hand if you feel pretty confident and you wanted to come share,67,0,nan
Session-1,T,Carson you want to bring your book up here,67,1,nan
Session-1,T,You lay your book right on top of mine and we should be able to see it really well,67,0,nan
Session-1,T,Can you talk us through what you did,67,5,nan
Session-1,S,I Jesse the  three up there and then multiply 3 times 2 equals 6,68,nan,4
Session-1,S,Then add 2 zeros and multiply 4 times 2 equals 12 8,68,nan,4
Session-1,T,Oh look at that revision right there good job lady,69,0,nan
Session-1,T,It helps to talk yourself through it doesnt it,69,1,nan
Session-1,T,So your answer will change a little bit wont it,69,1,nan
Session-1,T,Im glad you saw that and we didnt have to correct you,69,0,nan
Session-1,S,4 times 2 equals 8,70,nan,4
Session-1,S,600 so I need to multiply 600 plus 80 equals 680,70,nan,4
Session-1,T,Any disagreements with how Carson set up her partition rectangle,71,2,nan
Session-1,T,Jesse,71,1,nan
Session-1,S,Well Im not in disagreement but,72,nan,1
Session-1,T,She just talked you through,73,0,nan
Session-1,T,What did you do differently,73,2,nan
Session-1,S,Well I think she got 600 for 20 times 30 but I didnt get that,74,nan,1
Session-1,T,Did you forget to add 2 zeros,75,1,nan
Session-1,S,Yes,76,nan,0
Session-1,T,Do you see where your revision would happen,77,1,nan
Session-1,T,Okay,77,0,nan
Session-1,T,Anyone else have a different response,77,2,nan
Session-1,T,Anyone do it differently as far as the partition rectangle goes,77,2,nan
Session-1,T,Everyone on the count of three were going to give Carson a big excellent,77,0,nan
Session-1,T,One two three,77,0,nan
Session-1,S,Excellent,78,nan,0
Session-1,T,Thank you,79,0,nan
Session-1,T,My book is still up there so you wont see the partition rectangle anymore,79,0,nan
Session-1,T,Who got all the way to doing it partial product way,79,1,nan
Session-1,T,Anyone feel pretty confident about how they did it and would be willing to share,79,5,nan
Session-1,T,These hands went Matt feeling confident,79,1,nan
Session-1,T,Put your book right on top of mine and well be able to see what youre doing,79,0,nan
Session-1,S,I did 2 times 3 and added the zeros so I got 600,80,nan,4
Session-1,S,I got 600 because of the 2 zeros,80,nan,4
Session-1,S,Then I did 2 times 4 and then I added a zero and got 80,80,nan,4
Session-1,S,Then put plus 80,80,nan,4
Session-1,S,606,80,nan,4
Session-1,S,88,80,nan,4
Session-1,S,0,80,nan,4
Session-1,T,Anyone do it differently,81,2,nan
Session-1,T,Dakota do you have a different answer or did you just do the process differently,81,2,nan
Session-1,S,I did the process differently,82,nan,1
Session-1,T,Okay thank you,83,0,nan
Session-1,T,Lets give Matt a yeehaw,83,0,nan
Session-1,T,Yeehaw,84,0,nan
Session-1,T,Thank you Matt for being brave,85,0,nan
Session-1,T,All right Dakota go show us what you did differently,85,0,nan
Session-1,T,It takes a lot of courage to go up there,85,0,nan
Session-1,S,I wrote down 30 plus 20times 20,86,nan,3
Session-1,T,Times 20 thank you,87,3,nan
Session-1,S,then I put 30 times 20 equals 600,88,nan,4
Session-1,S,Then I added 4 times 20 equals 80 and then I got 680,88,nan,4
Session-1,T,So you did it right underneath the way that they kind of modeled for us,89,1,nan
Session-1,S,Yes,90,nan,0
Session-1,T,Everyone understand and agree,91,2,nan
Session-1,T,Any disagreements on how Matt or Dakota solved their problem,91,2,nan
Session-1,S,No,92,nan,1
Session-1,T,Lets give her a shhshhshhshhshh your great,93,0,nan
Session-1,T,Shhshhshhshhshh your great,94,0,nan
Session-1,T,Thank you for sharing,95,0,nan
Session-1,T,All right my friends,95,0,nan
Session-1,T,Were going to do a couple of practice questions,95,0,nan
Session-1,T,Take out your whiteboard,95,0,nan
Session-1,T,Please show me a partition rectangle for the problem 30 times 87 on your whiteboard,96,0,nan
Session-1,T,A partition rectangle of 30 and 87,96,0,nan
Session-1,T,All right what I want you to do is look at your face partner,97,0,nan
Session-1,T,Carson come,97,0,nan
Session-1,T,You guys be just a group of three,97,0,nan
Session-1,T,Actually Dallas will you go be Carsons face partner a little bit,97,0,nan
Session-1,T,face partner on the table and one of yours is Lisa,97,0,nan
Session-1,T,You be partners with Megan,97,0,nan
Session-1,T,Please go quick or Carson you can go there,97,0,nan
Session-1,T,It might be easier if you can go up there,97,0,nan
Session-1,T,I want you to take your whiteboard and swap with your face partner,97,0,nan
Session-1,T,I want you to analyze all these little problems,97,0,nan
Session-1,T,If you disagree I want you to talk about what you didnt do or if you have questions about what they did,97,0,nan
Session-1,T,Can you listen to directions first so you know what you need to do,98,0,nan
Session-1,T,Thank you,98,0,nan
Session-1,T,Analyze what your partner did,98,0,nan
Session-1,T,See if you can follow the steps that they took,98,0,nan
Session-1,T,Make sure you agree with them,98,0,nan
Session-1,T,If you disagree or youre confused on what steps they took I want you to ask them about it,98,0,nan
Session-1,T,Why did you write 240,98,6,nan
Session-1,T,Why did you write 180,98,6,nan
Session-1,T,Why did you add these numbers together,98,6,nan
Session-1,T,I dont understand how you can put your rectangle,98,0,nan
Session-1,T,Those are the kinds of questions I want you to be asking each other,98,0,nan
Session-1,T,If you totally agree I want you to describe what your partner did,98,0,nan
Session-1,T,I see that you split your rectangle into blah blah blah because Talk through your problems,98,0,nan
Session-1,T,Make sure you give your partner  that,98,0,nan
Session-1,T,Thank you for  to explain,98,0,nan
Session-1,T,I would like Jesse and Faith to come and explain how they did their problem,98,5,nan
Session-1,T,I need you to come up and you can just show on your whiteboard if you want,98,0,nan
Session-1,T,You can write on my whiteboard if you want,98,0,nan
Session-1,T,Is that marker not working,98,0,nan
Session-1,S,Three times seven that equals 21,99,nan,4
Session-1,S,Then I added a zero because theres a zero to three and I added three times eight equals 24,99,nan,4
Session-1,S,Then I added two zeros,99,nan,4
Session-1,T,Did you really,100,1,nan
Session-1,S,Yes,101,nan,0
Session-1,T,All right where,102,5,nan
Session-1,T,How,102,5,nan
Session-1,T,Keep that,104,0,nan
Session-1,T,What did you notice that Faith did while she was reworking her problem,104,2,nan
Session-1,T,Because this is really what she had on her original whiteboard and Richard had on his original whiteboard,104,0,nan
Session-1,T,What did she do as she was working through the second time Jocelyn,104,2,nan
Session-1,S,When she did 30 times 80 she forgot to add another zero,105,nan,1
Session-1,T,But as she was working it did she actually do it right the first time,106,2,nan
Session-1,S,Yes,107,nan,0
Session-1,T,She did,108,4,nan
Session-1,T,Thats why I said Really you did,108,0,nan
Session-1,T,because when you first worked it you just added one zero but when you worked it the second time you actually did it right,108,0,nan
Session-1,T,How many extra zeros are in the  problem,108,5,nan
Session-1,S,Two,109,nan,3
Session-1,T,When you started working it the second time you realized that actually should have two zeros because eight times three is 24 but with an extra 10 here and another extra 10 here theres only going to be two zeros,110,4,nan
Session-1,T,Every single person except for You missed that the first time right Pat,110,1,nan
Session-1,T,Most of you are being really careful to make sure you add the zeros on,110,0,nan
Session-1,T,It makes a huge difference,110,0,nan
Session-1,T,2400 is not very close to 240 is it,110,1,nan
Session-1,S,No,111,nan,0
Session-1,T,Makes a huge difference on the total amount of your product when you finally add everything together,112,0,nan
Session-1,T,That was really cool to watch you,112,0,nan
Session-1,T,You had it and then I asked you and you were like Oh wait wait,112,0,nan
Session-1,T,No,112,0,nan
Session-1,T,Joel thank you,112,0,nan
Session-1,S,Me and David did the same thing just,113,nan,1
Session-1,T,Then when I walked by it was like,114,0,nan
Session-1,S,Can we show what we did,115,nan,0
Session-1,T,Yes you can use your whiteboard,116,0,nan
Session-1,T,Thank you guys lets give them a roller coaster,116,0,nan
Session-1,T,there you go,117,0,nan
Session-1,S,So David,118,nan,0
Session-1,S,Before Joel corrected me I wrote 240 right here because I thought 30 times 80 was 240 and then Joel told me that I had to add two extra zeros and the I got 2610,119,nan,4
Session-1,T,2610 is very different than 500something isnt,120,1,nan
Session-1,S,Before we did that David,121,nan,0
Session-1,S,When we put the extra zero to 240 he thought it was going be 405  but then he realized that it needed this,121,nan,4
Session-1,T,Can I draw the columns for you,122,0,nan
Session-1,T,See thats the problem when you dont have your numbers in columns there you go,122,0,nan
Session-1,S,So we did zero zero zero,123,nan,3
Session-1,T,up for me a little bit there you go,124,0,nan
Session-1,S,426  we got 2610,125,nan,4
Session-1,T,Give it a high thumbs up if you got 2610,126,2,nan
Session-1,T,If you didnt get that if your high thumbs up isnt out do you realize what you needed to make it correct and accurate,126,1,nan
Session-1,T,Thank you guys for sharing lets give them,126,0,nan
Session-1,T,Thank you so much,127,0,nan
Session-1,T,All right lets look at your math journal page 130,127,0,nan
Session-1,T,Lets look at problem number two,128,0,nan
Session-1,T,With 34 on the bottom and 17 the side,128,0,nan
Session-1,T,This changes things a little bit because if we look at what we had before we had 20 and 34 it was easy to split our 34 into 30 plus 4,128,0,nan
Session-1,T,Whats different about our second number that were multiplying together,128,5,nan
Session-1,T,Clayton,128,1,nan
Session-1,S,Its twodigit numbers with no zeros,129,nan,3
Session-1,T,Yes its not just the multiple of 10 is it,130,1,nan
Session-1,T,17 isnt a multiple of 10 is it,130,1,nan
Session-1,S,No,131,nan,0
Session-1,T,Not a 10 20 30 40 easy number to multiply together so you might need to put that and create four boxes,132,0,nan
Session-1,T,Im actually going to move my 17 to the other side to make it a little bit easier,132,0,nan
Session-1,T,The 3 in 34 is worth what,132,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,133,nan,3
Session-1,T,30 the 4 in 34 is worth what,134,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,135,nan,3
Session-1,T,Zach what is the 1 in 17 worth,136,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,137,nan,3
Session-1,T,on the top row,138,0,nan
Session-1,T,Jasper what is the 7 is 17 worth,138,5,nan
Session-1,S,Seven,139,nan,3
Session-1,T,Seven,140,3,nan
Session-1,T,I just have more multiplication problems to do now,140,0,nan
Session-1,T,Im going to kind of like what you guys were doing remember that weird table we had to use when we were doing weird math where you had to bring the two together,140,1,nan
Session-1,T,Right here in this box Im going to zoom this in as much as I can without making it too blurry,140,0,nan
Session-1,T,In this box right here what multiplication fact am I going to do,140,5,nan
Session-1,S,30 times 10,141,nan,3
Session-1,T,What is 30 times 10,142,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,143,nan,3
Session-1,T,Not plus,144,0,nan
Session-1,T,Chandler,144,1,nan
Session-1,S,It is 130 oh no,145,nan,3
Session-1,T,30 times 10,146,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,147,nan,3
Session-1,T,300 sir youre correct,148,4,nan
Session-1,T,In the box right below it what multiplication problem am I going to solve,148,5,nan
Session-1,T,Joel,148,1,nan
Session-1,S,30 times 7,149,nan,3
Session-1,T,What is 30 times 7,150,5,nan
Session-1,T,David,150,1,nan
Session-1,S,nan,151,nan,3
Session-1,T,I have more multiplication problems to solve,152,0,nan
Session-1,T,What is 4 times 10,152,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,153,nan,3
Session-1,T,Joel,154,1,nan
Session-1,S,4 times 10 is 40,155,nan,4
Session-1,T,40 and then whats the multiplication problem for this last box,156,5,nan
Session-1,T,Josh,156,1,nan
Session-1,S,7 times 4,157,nan,3
Session-1,T,7 times 4 which is,158,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,159,nan,3
Session-1,T,Just 28 because there are no extra zeros just 28,160,4,nan
Session-1,T,Now Im going to add up all these products small products that I got in the middle of my boxes Im going to add all those together,160,0,nan
Session-1,T,I have to do 3002104028,160,0,nan
Session-1,T,Is this going to be really important for you to line up your places properly,160,1,nan
Session-1,S,Yes,161,nan,0
Session-1,T,Yes make sure all your ones are lined up all your tens are lined up all your 100 are lined up,162,0,nan
Session-1,T,Im going to let you solve that real quick,162,0,nan
Session-1,T,Thumbs up when you have the,162,1,nan
Session-1,T,Brant what did you get,163,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,164,nan,3
Session-1,T,578 anyone get something different,165,2,nan
Session-1,T,Joel what did you get,165,5,nan
Session-1,S,I thought 378,166,nan,3
Session-1,S,Oh I see that,168,nan,0
Session-1,T,You see what you got,169,1,nan
Session-1,T,Everyone else got 578,169,1,nan
Session-1,S,Yes,170,nan,3
Session-1,T,Go to the next box over,171,0,nan
Session-1,T,Were going to write this problem as 34 times 17,171,0,nan
Session-1,T,I want you to get used to going Oh yes oh yes oh yes oh yes,171,0,nan
Session-1,T,The reason why Im having you go here and here is because you have to multiply all the values times each other and it looks like this,171,0,nan
Session-1,T,Ill show you what I mean,171,0,nan
Session-1,T,What is the value of these three right here,171,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,172,nan,3
Session-1,T,nan,173,3,nan
Session-1,T,I need to multiply that times the value of this digit right here which is,173,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,174,nan,3
Session-1,T,10 Im done here,175,4,nan
Session-1,T,Now Im going to take this value of this digit which was what,175,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,176,nan,3
Session-1,T,30 and I have to multiply it here whats the value of this digit,177,5,nan
Session-1,S,Seven,178,nan,3
Session-1,T,Seven Im done with Uh uh I need to take the value of this digit what was that,179,5,nan
Session-1,S,One,180,nan,3
Session-1,S,nan,181,nan,1
Session-1,T,Its worth 10,182,4,nan
Session-1,T,I need to multiply here,182,0,nan
Session-1,T,Whats this digit worth,182,5,nan
Session-1,S,Four,183,nan,3
Session-1,S,Four,184,nan,1
Session-1,T,I need to do this last one,185,0,nan
Session-1,T,The value of this times this is,185,5,nan
Session-1,S,4 times 7,186,nan,3
Session-1,T,I can multiplytwodigitstimestwodigits,187,0,nan
Session-1,T,Okay,187,0,nan
Session-1,T,Once you get all your facts sorted out then you could find the answers to them and you add them all together,187,0,nan
Session-1,T,What is 3 times 1,187,5,nan
Session-1,S,Three,188,nan,3
Session-1,T,3 times 1 is 3 and I have two extra zeros on the end of that 73,189,4,nan
Session-1,T,What is 3 times 7,189,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,190,nan,3
Session-1,S,nan,191,nan,1
Session-1,T,Along with an extra zero,192,0,nan
Session-1,T,10 times 4,192,0,nan
Session-1,S,nan,193,nan,3
Session-1,T,7 times 4,194,5,nan
Session-1,S,nan,195,nan,3
Session-1,T,Add them all together making sure all of your columns are appropriately lined up,196,0,nan
Session-1,T,I have a feeling youre going to get a very common answer with your,196,0,nan
Session-1,S,nan,197,nan,3
Session-1,T,again,198,0,nan
Session-1,S,nan,199,nan,3
Session-1,T,Do these two things match,200,5,nan
Session-1,S,Yes,201,nan,0
Session-1,T,You did was effective,202,0,nan
Session-1,T,Okay,202,0,nan
Session-1,T,Youre going to practice trying the partial product,202,0,nan
Session-1,T,It does not matter what order you do them in as long as all values get multiplied times each other,202,0,nan
Session-1,T,Never going straight across,202,0,nan
Session-1,T,We dont break 80 and 7 into Looks like this,202,0,nan
Session-1,T,Beside each other because thats part of your number,202,0,nan
Session-1,T,Just think about  Okay,202,1,nan
Session-1,T,Try it,202,0,nan
Session-1,T,If you get stuck imagine what youre doing thousands of numbers and we come look over here to  how they did it,202,0,nan
Session-1,T,Have at it,202,0,nan
Session-1,T,This is on your own,202,0,nan
Session-1,T,Okay,202,0,nan
Session-1,T,Yes you may have your snacks,203,0,nan
Session-1,S,I chew one or just,204,nan,0
Session-2,T,All right,1,0,nan
Session-2,T,Who did the fractions for 15,1,1,nan
Session-2,T,Liam tell me what you came up with,2,5,nan
Session-2,S,210 315 420 525,3,nan,3
Session-2,T,Howd you figure those out,4,5,nan
Session-2,T,What did you do,4,5,nan
Session-2,S,By doing 1  1,5,nan,3
Session-2,T,You added,6,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yes I did,7,nan,0
Session-2,T,So you added on the top,8,0,nan
Session-2,T,What did you do on the bottom,8,5,nan
Session-2,S,I counted by 5,9,nan,3
Session-2,T,You counted by 5,10,4,nan
Session-2,T,Bryce can you restate what you just heard Liam say,10,1,nan
Session-2,T,What did he do to get 210 and 315,10,2,nan
Session-2,S,He added,11,nan,1
Session-2,T,He added what,12,2,nan
Session-2,S,I didnt hear,13,nan,0
Session-2,T,You didnt hear him,14,1,nan
Session-2,T,Liam will you please tell Bryce what you just said,14,1,nan
Session-2,T,I said that I did it 1  1  1 and then I did,15,4,nan
Session-2,T,Does that make sense to you how he would get those,16,2,nan
Session-2,T,Adding ones at the top but counting by fives at the bottom,16,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yes,17,nan,1
Session-2,T,That makes sense to you,18,2,nan
Session-2,T,Katie does that make sense to you,18,2,nan
Session-2,S,Yes a little bit,19,nan,1
Session-2,T,Will that work with all fractions,20,1,nan
Session-2,S,No,21,nan,0
Session-2,T,Why does it work when we have a one at the top,22,6,nan
Session-2,S,Because one is a factor of everything,23,nan,4
Session-2,T,What did you say Maddox,24,1,nan
Session-2,S,Because one is a factor of everything,25,nan,4
Session-2,T,Ones a factor of everything,26,3,nan
Session-2,T,So you can add this one all the time,26,0,nan
Session-2,T,Did anyone do 24 as their pink problem,26,1,nan
Session-2,T,Okay Stephan,26,1,nan
Session-2,S,What I do is I multiplied 2 2 times and I got 4,27,nan,4
Session-2,S,And then I added by 4 2 times and I got 8,27,nan,4
Session-2,T,So there was another one that you got because you had to do two for each,28,0,nan
Session-2,T,Did you get another one,28,1,nan
Session-2,S,I multiplied 2 x 3 and I got 6,29,nan,4
Session-2,S,Then I multiplied 4 x 3 and I got 12,29,nan,4
Session-2,T,Hi,30,0,nan
Session-2,T,I cant find my new  Where would they be,31,0,nan
Session-2,T,I put mine up on shelf but I dont know,32,0,nan
Session-2,T,I checked every one,33,0,nan
Session-2,T,Are they up on the top of the shelf out here,34,0,nan
Session-2,T,Thank you,35,0,nan
Session-2,T,Youre welcome,36,0,nan
Session-2,T,So Stephan said I multiplied 2 x 2 to get 4 and 4 x 2 to get 8,36,0,nan
Session-2,T,What did you hear him say about how to get 612,36,2,nan
Session-2,T,Avery what did you hear Stephan say for him to go from 24 to get to 612,36,2,nan
Session-2,T,He started here,36,0,nan
Session-2,S,You multiply 2 x 4,37,nan,1
Session-2,T,Two times,38,5,nan
Session-2,S,nan,39,nan,3
Session-2,T,What would you multiply 2 by to get 6,40,5,nan
Session-2,S,nan,41,nan,3
Session-2,T,2 x 4 is 8,42,4,nan
Session-2,S,Oh,43,nan,0
Session-2,S,2 x 3,43,nan,3
Session-2,T,There you go,44,0,nan
Session-2,T,What did he multiply 4 by to get 12,44,2,nan
Session-2,T,Also,44,0,nan
Session-2,S,nan,45,nan,1
Session-2,T,Also 3,46,4,nan
Session-2,T,Remember that when youre making an equivalent fraction if youre multiplying the top number and the bottom number by the same thing,46,0,nan
Session-2,T,So 3 on the bottom 3 on the top,46,0,nan
Session-2,T,Youre going to get an equivalent fraction,46,0,nan
Session-2,T,Who did 23 as theirs,46,1,nan
Session-2,T,The pink problem,46,1,nan
Session-2,T,Bryce whatd you end up doing,46,5,nan
Session-2,S,I got 4 out of 6 and 6 out of 9 by doing what was,47,nan,4
Session-2,T,You did multiples,48,1,nan
Session-2,T,So you did multiples of 2,48,1,nan
Session-2,S,Mmhmm,49,nan,0
Session-2,T,So when you started listing your multiples you need 2 4 6,50,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yes,51,nan,0
Session-2,T,Okay,52,0,nan
Session-2,T,Ryder can you tell me how that makes sense to you,52,2,nan
Session-2,T,Why did Bryce do multiples,52,2,nan
Session-2,S,Everything multiple because its like youre doing the same number,53,nan,4
Session-2,S,Its not the same number but its equivalent to the number,53,nan,4
Session-2,T,Okay,54,0,nan
Session-2,T,Any other suggestions on how that could work,54,5,nan
Session-2,T,Who did 410,54,1,nan
Session-2,T,Its a green one,54,0,nan
Session-2,T,Taylor whatd you get as equivalent,54,5,nan
Session-2,S,120,55,nan,3
Session-2,T,Okay,56,0,nan
Session-2,T,Did you do another one,56,1,nan
Session-2,T,You just did one,56,1,nan
Session-2,T,How did you get 820,56,5,nan
Session-2,S,I did 2 x 4 and then 2 x 10,57,nan,4
Session-2,T,All right,58,0,nan
Session-2,T,Could you add on and do the next multiple for 410,58,5,nan
Session-2,T,Jamie,58,1,nan
Session-2,S,1230,59,nan,3
Session-2,T,There you go,60,0,nan
Session-2,T,Good job,60,0,nan
Session-2,T,So he did multiples times 2,60,0,nan
Session-2,T,You can do the multiples times 3,60,0,nan
Session-2,T,Great,60,0,nan
Session-2,T,Anyone do 312,60,1,nan
Session-2,T,Rob whatd you get,60,5,nan
Session-2,S,12 x 2  24 and 3 x 2  6,61,nan,4
Session-2,T,Okay,62,0,nan
Session-2,T,So 624,62,5,nan
Session-2,S,And 12 x 4 is 48 and 3 x 4 is 12,63,nan,4
Session-2,T,So just doing the number,64,0,nan
Session-2,S,A book here in the office,65,nan,0
Session-2,T,Okay Ill send her down in just a little bit,66,0,nan
Session-2,T,Her down not him down,66,0,nan
Session-2,T,Your books here,66,0,nan
Session-2,T,But wait till were done okay,66,1,nan
Session-2,T,So you did the top number and bottom number times 2 here and times 4 here,66,0,nan
Session-2,T,So you skipped the most parts which is totally fine,66,0,nan
Session-2,T,Anyone do 810,66,1,nan
Session-2,T,Caleb talk to me,66,0,nan
Session-2,S,I switched the 120200,67,nan,3
Session-2,T,You did what,68,0,nan
Session-2,S,Wait no no no,69,nan,0
Session-2,S,That was not 1620,69,nan,3
Session-2,T,You were doing the one below,70,0,nan
Session-2,S,Yes,71,nan,0
Session-2,T,1620 tell me how you got that,72,5,nan
Session-2,S,I multiplied 8 x 2 I got 16,73,nan,4
Session-2,S,Then I did 10 x 2 and I got 20,73,nan,4
Session-2,S,And then I got 2430,73,nan,4
Session-2,T,Explain that one,74,0,nan
Session-2,S,I multiplied 8 x 3 and then 10 x 3,75,nan,4
Session-2,T,All right,76,0,nan
Session-2,T,Jade did you do 68,76,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yes I did,77,nan,0
Session-2,S,So I got 1216,77,nan,3
Session-2,T,Explain please,78,5,nan
Session-2,S,I looked at the my multiplication table and I got the 12 and then I did the 8 the same way,79,nan,4
Session-2,T,What is that called when youre using your multiplication chart to help you,80,5,nan
Session-2,S,I dont know whats it called,81,nan,0
Session-2,T,You found the,82,5,nan
Session-2,S,I found the product,83,nan,3
Session-2,T,Theyre called products when you multiply numbers together but when were listing in order the products are the problem,84,4,nan
Session-2,T,What are those called,84,5,nan
Session-2,T,Look up there on your poster,84,0,nan
Session-2,T,See if that helps you,84,0,nan
Session-2,T,Making your numbers bigger,84,0,nan
Session-2,S,Multiples,85,nan,3
Session-2,T,Multiples,86,3,nan
Session-2,T,You found multiples,86,0,nan
Session-2,T,What was another equivalent fraction,86,5,nan
Session-2,S,1824,87,nan,3
Session-2,T,Okay,88,0,nan
Session-2,T,Maddox,88,1,nan
Session-2,S,Another one for,89,nan,0
Session-2,T,You got one here,90,1,nan
Session-2,S,One,91,nan,3
Session-2,T,What,92,0,nan
Session-2,S,I thought you Never mind,93,nan,0
Session-2,T,Oh you were going for a different one,94,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yes,95,nan,0
Session-2,T,Okay can we move forward,96,1,nan
Session-2,T,Did you do 25100 at all,96,1,nan
Session-2,T,No,96,1,nan
Session-2,T,Katie whatd you get for 25100,96,5,nan
Session-2,S,One is 50200,97,nan,4
Session-2,S,Then I got 75300,97,nan,4
Session-2,T,Howd you do those,98,5,nan
Session-2,S,I did 25 x 2 which equals 50,99,nan,4
Session-2,S,Then 100 x 2 which is 200,99,nan,4
Session-2,S,Then I multiplied one more to 25 to get to 75,99,nan,4
Session-2,S,Same with the 200 to get to 300ths,99,nan,4
Session-2,T,Okay excellent,100,0,nan
Session-2,T,Anyone do 16100,100,1,nan
Session-2,T,Nobody at this middle table did any math,100,1,nan
Session-2,S,No,101,nan,0
Session-2,T,Jamie did one,102,0,nan
Session-2,T,Anyone at this middle table do any math here,102,1,nan
Session-2,S,We did,103,nan,0
Session-2,T,I havent heard from you,104,0,nan
Session-2,T,All right Caleb tell me what you did,104,5,nan
Session-2,S,I did 120200,105,nan,3
Session-2,T,Why did you do that,106,6,nan
Session-2,S,Because I multiplied 60 x 2,107,nan,4
Session-2,S,I got 120 and then I did 100 x 2,107,nan,4
Session-2,S,Then,107,nan,0
Session-2,T,You have another one,108,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yes,109,nan,0
Session-2,S,I got 180300,109,nan,4
Session-2,S,I did that by doing 60 x 3 and 100 x 3,109,nan,4
Session-2,T,Excellent,110,0,nan
Session-2,T,Did anyone reduce this down to a smaller fraction,110,1,nan
Session-2,S,What,111,nan,0
Session-2,S,Uhuh,111,nan,0
Session-2,T,Oh hi,112,0,nan
Session-2,T,I dont want math,112,0,nan
Session-2,T,Where did that come from,112,0,nan
Session-2,T,Jeez sorry,113,0,nan
Session-2,T,Well thats crazy,113,0,nan
Session-2,T,Technology went a little crazy with me this morning sorry guys,114,0,nan
Session-2,T,Well its showing up weird isnt it,115,0,nan
Session-2,T,Its not in my Google Docs this is a Google Doc,115,0,nan
Session-2,T,Anyway lets try this again,115,0,nan
Session-2,T,Did anyone reduce that fraction down,115,1,nan
Session-2,T,If we have 6100 is there a smaller portion that could,115,0,nan
Session-2,T,What do you think Sophie,116,5,nan
Session-2,S,Maybe 610,116,nan,3
Session-2,T,610,117,3,nan
Session-2,T,Think of your place value tens and hundreds that we were looking at,117,0,nan
Session-2,T,If you colored in 60 little cubes out of the 100 how many of those would be tenths,117,5,nan
Session-2,S,Six,118,nan,3
Session-2,T,Six of them,119,4,nan
Session-2,T,Theres another way when you have big fractions like this a lot of times you can make them smaller versions or they call it reducing your fraction okay,119,1,nan
Session-2,T,Any questions on that,119,1,nan
Session-2,T,Katie,119,1,nan
Session-2,S,Its not a question but I have another I think for 60100,120,nan,3
Session-2,T,What,121,1,nan
Session-2,S,6001000,122,nan,3
Session-2,T,Yes so that would be making it grow bigger,123,0,nan
Session-2,S,Okay,124,nan,0
Session-2,T,All right how many of you used your faction circles to help you figure out what piece the third would be if you had three of them,125,1,nan
Session-2,S,Oh I got a circle,126,nan,3
Session-2,T,Show me,127,0,nan
Session-2,T,Show me on your fraction circle what that would be,127,0,nan
Session-2,S,Yes I didnt have a fraction circle so I did this,128,nan,3
Session-2,T,Okay the problem says take out your fraction several pieces sort them into colors,129,0,nan
Session-2,T,If one light blue is a third what one piece would be the whole,129,5,nan
Session-2,T,How many blue pieces would I need to make the whole thing,129,5,nan
Session-2,T,I see Alice showing me three fingers I see Katie showing me three fingers,129,0,nan
Session-2,T,If this one is one of the third this would be two thirds that would be three thirds,129,0,nan
Session-2,T,What shape is that,129,5,nan
Session-2,S,Half circle,130,nan,3
Session-2,T,Its a halfcircle,131,4,nan
Session-2,T,What color is our half circle,131,5,nan
Session-2,S,Pink,132,nan,3
Session-2,S,White,133,nan,1
Session-2,T,One pink,134,0,nan
Session-2,T,Onethird twothirds threethirds is equal to halfcircle or a pink one,134,0,nan
Session-2,T,Were not focusing on a full circle being our whole today were thinking outside the box,134,0,nan
Session-2,T,The whole is going to be a little bit different,134,0,nan
Session-2,T,Okay so can you show me that on your table,135,0,nan
Session-2,T,Get your three blues out,135,0,nan
Session-2,T,You still have fraction circles in your desk,135,0,nan
Session-2,T,Do you have fraction circles in here,135,0,nan
Session-2,T,Yes you do,135,0,nan
Session-2,T,All right the question asked you if one light blue is one third what one piece would be the whole okay,136,1,nan
Session-2,T,Youre thinking about the top number tells you how many youre focusing on,136,0,nan
Session-2,T,So were focusing on one of them,136,0,nan
Session-2,T,Your denominator tells you what,136,5,nan
Session-2,T,What does the denominator or the bottom number tell you,136,5,nan
Session-2,S,The whole number,137,nan,3
Session-2,T,The whole number of pieces it takes,138,4,nan
Session-2,T,Right now we know the denominator is three,138,0,nan
Session-2,T,This whole thing is cut into three equal parts,138,0,nan
Session-2,T,This is one of them that would be two of them that would be three of them,138,0,nan
Session-2,T,Then its just basically asking you what piece is equal to that,138,0,nan
Session-2,T,If you lay your halfcircle or your pink piece on there those are equal,138,0,nan
Session-2,T,Heres your next question,139,0,nan
Session-2,T,Take out your purple pieces,139,0,nan
Session-2,T,Remember that theyre different from dark blue so make sure youre getting purple not dark blue,139,0,nan
Session-2,T,We want this one,139,0,nan
Session-2,S,The tenths,139,nan,3
Session-2,T,The tenths,140,3,nan
Session-2,T,Take out your purple pieces,140,0,nan
Session-2,S,These arent purple,141,nan,0
Session-2,T,Rob if you go over to I think its the first column second go down the stairs there are bags of fraction circle pieces you may borrow,142,0,nan
Session-2,T,There should be four or five  Did everybody find their purple pieces,142,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yes,143,nan,0
Session-2,T,All right this is going to be onefourth of a new shape how many of them would we need to make the whole thing,144,5,nan
Session-2,T,Show me on your fingers,144,1,nan
Session-2,T,That purple piece is one fourth four four four four four four four four four four four four three four four four four four four,144,0,nan
Session-2,T,Okay one out of the four pieces it needs this is one of them two of them three of them four of them okay,144,1,nan
Session-2,T,Is that more or less than what you just had with your light blue pieces,144,5,nan
Session-2,S,Less,145,nan,3
Session-2,T,Less why is it less,146,6,nan
Session-2,T,Stephan why is this onefourth fraction less than this onethird fraction,146,6,nan
Session-2,S,Its not even to like a half a circle because its missing the orange,147,nan,4
Session-2,T,Right if I were to lay this on top do you see right here theres some space missing underneath it would not be equal,148,4,nan
Session-2,T,Theres another group missing so youre right Stephan that would be right,148,0,nan
Session-2,T,What would the whole be,148,5,nan
Session-2,T,What would the whole be if I were looking at that would you put on top of that,148,5,nan
Session-2,T,Think about your different color pieces and leave them out there,148,0,nan
Session-2,T,That works,148,1,nan
Session-2,T,Does an orange piece work,148,1,nan
Session-2,T,Lay your orange piece on top of those four purples,148,0,nan
Session-2,T,Avery does that work,148,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yes,149,nan,0
Session-2,T,It does,150,1,nan
Session-2,T,Lets see,150,0,nan
Session-2,T,If I have all four four four  and I put this on top,150,0,nan
Session-2,T,Is there one single piece thats going to work,150,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yes,151,nan,0
Session-2,T,Prove it to me,152,0,nan
Session-2,T,You say yes you need to prove it to me,152,0,nan
Session-2,T,One single piece that will fit on all four purples,152,0,nan
Session-2,T,Do we have anything in between a pink and an orange,152,1,nan
Session-2,S,No,153,nan,0
Session-2,T,No and the shape of those four purples is really kind of halfway between a pink and an orange,154,4,nan
Session-2,T,We might need to use two pieces to cover up those four,154,0,nan
Session-2,T,Look for pieces where you add two together and it is kind of halfway between those two,154,0,nan
Session-2,T,You are using the wrong color sweetheart you need this color thats the dark blue use four of these ones instead,154,0,nan
Session-2,T,Get all four of your purple use four of them honey,154,0,nan
Session-2,T,I see people trying blues,154,0,nan
Session-2,T,Katie what did you try,154,5,nan
Session-2,S,Two fifths,155,nan,3
Session-2,T,You did two green huh,156,1,nan
Session-2,T,Lets focus just on the color because when we say fifth that means were thinking of the whole as a full circle,156,0,nan
Session-2,T,Are we really doing the whole as a full circle right now,156,1,nan
Session-2,S,No,157,nan,0
Session-2,T,What is the whole Katie,158,5,nan
Session-2,S,Two fifths,159,nan,3
Session-2,T,Two colors,160,1,nan
Session-2,S,Two greens,161,nan,3
Session-2,T,Two greens,162,3,nan
Session-2,T,Pull out two dark greens not light greens but dark greens,162,0,nan
Session-2,T,We only have three fourth Thats one fourth,163,0,nan
Session-2,T,There it was sorry,163,0,nan
Session-2,T,the purple,163,0,nan
Session-2,T,We try two dark greens,163,0,nan
Session-2,T,Does everybody see the two dark greens filled up the space of those four purples,163,1,nan
Session-2,T,These are not friendly to us are they,163,0,nan
Session-2,T,I wish there were a better tool for us to use than these paper ones that weve got cut out because theyre not very easy to work with,163,0,nan
Session-2,S,I wish the foam ones,164,nan,0
Session-2,T,Yes I wish we all had enough foam ones to use,165,0,nan
Session-2,S,Theyre easier to place together,166,nan,0
Session-2,T,Youre gonna try your very best today to use your fraction circle pieces to try to get to the whole,167,0,nan
Session-2,T,Its going to give you a portion of it then you have to try to figure out what the whole piece will be,167,0,nan
Session-2,T,Were focusing on colors,167,0,nan
Session-2,T,I have a question for you,167,0,nan
Session-2,T,If I needed to write an equation to show that this was my onethird how did I get to the whole thing,167,5,nan
Session-2,T,I had onethird but what else did I do,167,5,nan
Session-2,T,Alice,167,1,nan
Session-2,S,You add it to other thirds too,168,nan,3
Session-2,T,I added another third and another third right,169,1,nan
Session-2,T,This is a third this is a third this is a third,169,0,nan
Session-2,T,I added together a third plus a third plus a third what did I end up with,169,5,nan
Session-2,S,Threethirds,170,nan,3
Session-2,T,Threethirds I heard Brady say,171,4,nan
Session-2,T,Threethirds or whats that also called,171,5,nan
Session-2,S,A whole,172,nan,3
Session-2,T,One whole,173,4,nan
Session-2,T,Okay over here before I covered this up one purple was onefourth okay so right here,173,0,nan
Session-2,T,I had one fourth what did I add together to give me my whole piece,173,5,nan
Session-2,T,Connor what did I add together,173,5,nan
Session-2,T,Theres onefourth,173,0,nan
Session-2,T,I did plus two more fourths and then,174,5,nan
Session-2,T,I should have how many altogether,174,5,nan
Session-2,S,Four,175,nan,3
Session-2,T,Four of them so if I add another fourth okay I could say that,176,4,nan
Session-2,T,Could I take two of those purple pieces away and swap it out for yellow,176,1,nan
Session-2,T,I dont know see if that works,176,0,nan
Session-2,S,No you cant,177,nan,3
Session-2,T,No it wouldnt work,178,1,nan
Session-2,T,Could I swap it out for a green,178,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yes,179,nan,0
Session-2,T,Yes so remember that were not focusing on what these labels are right now were going to just focus on the color because our whole is not a full circle today,180,4,nan
Session-2,T,Okay challenging your brain to think outside the box,180,0,nan
Session-2,T,Very carefully scoot your fraction circle pieces aside,181,0,nan
Session-2,T,You will use them they are going to be very helpful to you but you want to be able to look at your math journal right now,181,0,nan
Session-2,T,If you open to page 157 we will do two problems together,181,0,nan
Session-2,T,Josh tell me which number you want me to do with you today,181,1,nan
Session-2,S,Number two,182,nan,0
Session-2,T,Number two okay everyone look at number two,183,0,nan
Session-2,T,What color piece do we need,183,5,nan
Session-2,S,Green,184,nan,3
Session-2,T,A light green,185,4,nan
Session-2,T,So take up your light greens,185,0,nan
Session-2,T,Josh tell me what does number two say,185,1,nan
Session-2,T,If light green is one fourth what is the whole,186,5,nan
Session-2,T,Aaron that tells me that light green needs how many totals to make the whole,186,5,nan
Session-2,S,That numerator says one,187,nan,3
Session-2,T,One and my denominator tells me how many to get to the whole thing,188,5,nan
Session-2,S,Four,189,nan,3
Session-2,T,Four of them,190,4,nan
Session-2,T,So how many light greens should you take out,190,5,nan
Session-2,S,Four,191,nan,3
Session-2,T,Four,192,3,nan
Session-2,T,Sophie what did I just show you on here,192,5,nan
Session-2,T,This is onefourth and what did I add together,192,5,nan
Session-2,S,The fourth,193,nan,3
Session-2,T,Heres one fourth another fourth heres another one,194,4,nan
Session-2,T,This is what threefourths,194,1,nan
Session-2,T,Whats this one worth,194,5,nan
Session-2,S,One,195,nan,3
Session-2,T,Onefourth plus,196,5,nan
Session-2,S,Onefourth,197,nan,3
Session-2,T,Okay did I create my whole,198,1,nan
Session-2,T,What does that equal,198,5,nan
Session-2,S,Fourfourths,199,nan,3
Session-2,T,Fourfourth or one,200,4,nan
Session-2,T,Now we have to decide what color piece is the whole,200,0,nan
Session-2,T,Now your job is to try to fit,200,0,nan
Session-2,T,whatever color will fit onto those four pieces so try them out see if you can figure out what color it might not be just one it might be two somethings,201,0,nan
Session-2,T,Try them out lay them on top see if you can figure out which one is the whole,201,0,nan
Session-2,T,Maddox and Katie found it hold your thoughts for just a minute,201,0,nan
Session-2,T,I dont have that shape in my circle but I do have it in my rectangle,201,0,nan
Session-2,T,Nope so try it a little bit bigger,201,0,nan
Session-2,T,Looks like Alice found it Caleb found it Avery found it Alex you found it,201,0,nan
Session-2,T,All right Caleb what piece did you find that is an equivalent for that whole,201,5,nan
Session-2,S,Fives,201,nan,3
Session-2,T,What color,202,5,nan
Session-2,S,Orange,203,nan,3
Session-2,T,Orange the orange piece is onethird of a full circle but its really one whole right now,204,4,nan
Session-2,T,Lets just say that were creating these really fancyshaped desserts,204,0,nan
Session-2,T,If this piece was a fourth of it we want to know what would be the whole thing well this orange slice this orange piece is the shape of the whole desserts,204,0,nan
Session-2,T,Maddox,204,1,nan
Session-2,S,It could be that or also could be two of these,205,nan,3
Session-2,T,It could be two light blues,206,4,nan
Session-2,T,Lets see if that works also,206,0,nan
Session-2,T,You know what Im going to do is lay the greens on top I think that makes it a little bit easier,206,0,nan
Session-2,T,Deely had a good idea she was doing it this way instead,206,0,nan
Session-2,T,Do you agree with Maddox,206,2,nan
Session-2,S,Yes,207,nan,1
Session-2,T,We could say its equal to one orange or two light blues,208,0,nan
Session-2,T,I agree with you Maddox that could be the whole,208,0,nan
Session-2,T,Katie,208,1,nan
Session-2,S,Three of the dark blues,209,nan,3
Session-2,T,Three dark blue lets see if that works,210,4,nan
Session-2,T,Do you agree with Katie that three dark blues could be the whole,210,2,nan
Session-2,S,Yes,211,nan,1
Session-2,T,Definitely,212,0,nan
Session-2,T,All right so you should have one of those choices written into your book,212,0,nan
Session-2,T,Make that a little bit bigger,212,0,nan
Session-2,T,Josh chose number two,212,0,nan
Session-2,T,Lets see whos chosing which other number we work on,212,0,nan
Session-2,T,Stephan what other number would you like us to do together,212,1,nan
Session-2,S,Number three,213,nan,0
Session-2,T,Number three,214,1,nan
Session-2,S,All right,214,nan,0
Session-2,T,Oh that ones a good one,214,0,nan
Session-2,T,Lets read really carefully,214,1,nan
Session-2,T,Stephan read that,214,1,nan
Session-2,S,If one light blue is twothirds what is the whole,215,nan,0
Session-2,T,All right so were considering these twothirds twothirds,216,0,nan
Session-2,T,If we were to split that in two equal parts each of them would be a third,216,0,nan
Session-2,T,This is twothirds so we need to think about how are we going to figure out what the other third would be,216,5,nan
Session-2,T,This is twothirds,216,0,nan
Session-2,T,Liam tell me what you would do to try to figure out what all threethirds would be,216,5,nan
Session-2,T,That is twothirds,216,0,nan
Session-2,T,You guys are still really stuck on thinking about what these fraction pieces mean for a whole circle,217,1,nan
Session-2,T,Our whole thing is not a full circle anymore were just focusing on the colors of them,218,0,nan
Session-2,T,This piece right here is two out of the three it takes to make the whole thing but its only one piece,218,0,nan
Session-2,T,How are you going to figure out how to make three,218,5,nan
Session-2,T,Alice talk to me what are you thinking,218,5,nan
Session-2,S,Youll take one light blue piece and take a different color like the light purple and then place it on top and see if thats half of it,218,nan,4
Session-2,T,Okay so youre trying to find something that would take two pieces to fill that up equally is that,219,4,nan
Session-2,T,what I hear you say,220,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yes,220,nan,0
Session-2,T,Do you hear that,221,1,nan
Session-2,T,Did you understand that,221,1,nan
Session-2,T,Nate what did you hear Alice say,221,1,nan
Session-2,S,That twothirds is equivalent to one of those,222,nan,3
Session-2,T,Well youre right thats true but what did she say,223,1,nan
Session-2,T,How is she going to find out what onethird is,223,2,nan
Session-2,T,If this is twothird how she going to figure out what to do How do you know what one of the thirds is if thats two then put them together into one piece,223,2,nan
Session-2,S,I said that you take the one light blue and then you take one light purple and its half of it then you might find out that thats onethird and so twothirds,224,nan,4
Session-2,T,Okay can you now repeat what she said,225,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yes so one blue is equivalent to two purples,226,nan,3
Session-2,T,You have to find what two pieces are equivalent to your one blue excellent,227,4,nan
Session-2,T,Lets see if she was right,227,0,nan
Session-2,T,She just started with guessing it it may be a purple because its about that same size,227,0,nan
Session-2,T,Try to see if you can find two pieces that are equal to your one light blue,227,0,nan
Session-2,T,If you havent raise your hand up high see if that works,227,1,nan
Session-2,T,Lay them on carefully because you want to make sure,227,0,nan
Session-2,T,Sophie what two pieces did you use to fill your one light blue,227,5,nan
Session-2,S,I used two light greens,228,nan,3
Session-2,T,Two light greens,229,3,nan
Session-2,T,Raise your hand if you got two light greens,229,1,nan
Session-2,T,If you didnt try two light greens,229,0,nan
Session-2,T,on top of your light blue and see if those are the same size,230,0,nan
Session-2,T,All right well thumbs up if you got two light greens on your one light blue and it worked pretty much,230,1,nan
Session-2,T,All right now tell me what is one light green worth as a fraction,230,5,nan
Session-2,T,If it were a full circle what now,230,5,nan
Session-2,S,Onethird,231,nan,3
Session-2,T,Alice says onethird,232,4,nan
Session-2,T,Jen do you agree disagree,232,2,nan
Session-2,T,Have a question about,232,1,nan
Session-2,S,I agree,233,nan,1
Session-2,T,Why do you agree,234,2,nan
Session-2,T,What is your light blue worth,234,5,nan
Session-2,S,Twothirds,235,nan,3
Session-2,T,Twothirds,236,4,nan
Session-2,T,We decided it took two light greens to equal two thirds,236,0,nan
Session-2,T,Why is it that Alice says this is worth onethird,236,2,nan
Session-2,S,Because it is half of twothirds and you have to use one so it will be onethird,237,nan,4
Session-2,T,Okay so I hear you saying that one of these is half of the twothirds and say what you said then,238,4,nan
Session-2,S,Since its half of that since its half of twothirds  one,239,nan,4
Session-2,T,Okay because half of two is one,240,4,nan
Session-2,T,We have our light blue is two thirds how many of these do we need to add to it to get to the whole,240,5,nan
Session-2,S,One,241,nan,3
Session-2,T,Just one of them right,242,1,nan
Session-2,T,Because twothirds plus onethird equals how much,242,5,nan
Session-2,S,Threethirds,243,nan,3
Session-2,T,Threethirds,244,3,nan
Session-2,T,Now you have another job,244,0,nan
Session-2,T,Now that you figured that out what piece what color piece is equal to that to make the whole,244,0,nan
Session-2,T,Lay your color piece on top thats your whole piece right there,244,0,nan
Session-2,T,You have your twothirds plus your onethird equals threethirds,244,0,nan
Session-2,T,What color piece to go on top of that shape right there,244,0,nan
Session-2,T,You have to lay a color on top of both of those pieces to make the whole because right now you have twothirds plus another third,244,0,nan
Session-2,T,I see John found it,244,0,nan
Session-2,T,It looks like Jen is testing to make sure she agrees with it,244,0,nan
Session-2,T,Alice found it Bryce found it Katie found it,244,0,nan
Session-2,T,It is truly one piece that will fit its not a tricker,244,0,nan
Session-2,T,Luke which one did you find,244,5,nan
Session-2,S,Yellow,245,nan,3
Session-2,T,Its a yellow everyone take your yellow piece out lay it on top of those two is that the same size,246,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yes,247,nan,0
Session-2,T,The two thirds plus the one third equals one yellow,248,0,nan
Session-2,T,Were not focusing on it as being a fourth of the circle were just focusing on it being the whole piece if this is two thirds,248,0,nan
Session-2,T,These are challenging you have to really use your fraction circle pieces to help you with this so Im going to let you work together on problem number one number four and number five you need to use your fraction circle pieces,248,0,nan
Session-2,T,Partner up figure it out help each other out I want to hear your answers in 15 minutes,248,0,nan
Session-2,S,Good how are you,249,nan,0
Session-2,T,thank you,250,0,nan
Session-2,T,and its not a whole circle it said its the whole so theyre giving you a fraction of the whole so they are saying if this piece is a fourth whats the fourth so they would have to put four of those together but then it says that this is 25 so this really is going to be,251,0,nan
Session-2,T,Someone lost their green fraction circle piece,252,0,nan
Session-2,T,Look at the bottom of it and see whose initials are on there are or number,252,0,nan
Session-2,T,Thank you Luke,252,0,nan
Session-2,T,Nope you can work on your own if youd like,252,0,nan
Session-2,T,Stephan I believe those are yours JS,253,0,nan
Session-2,T,What color shape it ends up being so if you have one of the fourth  whats the whole,254,5,nan
Session-2,T,Whats going to be the whole,254,5,nan
Session-2,T,If you have two of these its equal to that so one what,255,5,nan
Session-2,S,One half,256,nan,3
Session-2,T,Nope,257,0,nan
Session-2,S,One two,258,nan,3
Session-2,T,One two there you go,259,4,nan
Session-2,T,You are still thinking of your fraction as the circle we are not doing the whole circle there you go,259,0,nan
Session-2,T,Pam pam param pam,260,1,nan
Session-2,S,Pam pam,261,nan,0
Session-2,T,On problem number one you have one yellow is half so to create the whole thing you would put another yellow,262,0,nan
Session-2,T,Theyre asking you what piece what one piece if possible is the whole,262,5,nan
Session-2,T,This is half of a circle,262,0,nan
Session-2,T,Yes but right now you have a whole thing half and half,262,0,nan
Session-2,T,What piece is equal to that,262,5,nan
Session-2,T,One pink,262,0,nan
Session-2,T,Were now not answering one half because if this is the whole this is half,262,0,nan
Session-2,T,Yes this is half of a circle and weve been talking about if the circle is the whole these are our fractions,263,0,nan
Session-2,T,Theyre making you get rid of that in your brain which is not very fun because were really used to using that but if this is half of our shape we know we need another half to make a whole if they are asking you which shape is the whole,263,0,nan
Session-2,T,One pink is the whole,263,0,nan
Session-2,T,I dont want you to give me other equivalent fractions like  Oh four purples wouldnt equal that  Im asking you what shape is the whole,263,0,nan
Session-2,T,On number four they give you 25 you have to try to figure out what 15 is so you could do 15 15 15 15 five times to get your whole piece okay,263,1,nan
Session-2,T,You only have about three more minutes before I ask you for your help in answering this so really try to get number four number five done okay go,263,0,nan
Session-2,T,Pam pam param pam,263,1,nan
Session-2,S,Pam pam,264,nan,0
Session-2,T,Please put your fraction circle pieces back together before you leave your spot so that youre not leaving fraction circle pieces behind,265,0,nan
Session-2,T,Head back to your desk I know you will be ready to start talking about this when youre sitting quietly ready to share how you came up with your responses go,265,0,nan
Session-2,T,I am recording those of you who are moving quickly into transition,266,0,nan
Session-2,T,Put it on the table by you there,266,0,nan
Session-2,T,Put it on the table by you,266,0,nan
Session-2,T,Thank you for your quick transitions looking at number one when yellow piece was half of our shape so how many would it take to make the whole thing,266,5,nan
Session-2,S,Two,267,nan,3
Session-2,T,Two of them if I put two of them together what color does that equal,268,5,nan
Session-2,S,Pink one pink,269,nan,3
Session-2,T,One pink,270,3,nan
Session-2,T,I just did half of it plus another half equaled to two halves or one whole pink okay,270,1,nan
Session-2,T,They always give you the easy one first dont they,270,1,nan
Session-2,T,Okay go down to number four they said one dark green is worth 25 talk to me about what I have to do in order to figure out what 55 would be,270,0,nan
Session-2,T,If this is 25 Maddox what did you do to figure out what 55 would be,270,5,nan
Session-2,S,We need 25  the half of 25 so what should be 15,271,nan,2
Session-2,T,You need another 15 right,272,1,nan
Session-2,T,You need to figure out what one of the 15 will be so Maddox is saying we have to split that dark green into two equal parts so you have to try to find what few pieces fit on that dark green,272,0,nan
Session-2,T,Was it purple,272,1,nan
Session-2,T,Was it dark blue,272,1,nan
Session-2,T,Was it light green,272,1,nan
Session-2,T,What was it,272,5,nan
Session-2,T,Avery,272,1,nan
Session-2,S,Purple,273,nan,3
Session-2,T,It was a purple right,274,1,nan
Session-2,T,So two purples fill in one dark green,274,0,nan
Session-2,T,So one purple is worth what fraction,274,5,nan
Session-2,T,Maddox told us it was 15,274,0,nan
Session-2,T,So we can have 25 which would be green plus 25,274,0,nan
Session-2,T,That one is not cut very well,274,0,nan
Session-2,T,Which is another green,274,0,nan
Session-2,T,That gave us 45,274,0,nan
Session-2,T,Is that the whole thing,274,1,nan
Session-2,T,Whats the whole thing,274,5,nan
Session-2,S,nan,275,nan,3
Session-2,T,55 so then if I add that little purple piece thats the whole shape,276,4,nan
Session-2,T,What is the whole shape,276,5,nan
Session-2,S,One pink,277,nan,3
Session-2,S,One yellow,278,nan,1
Session-2,T,One yellow,279,1,nan
Session-2,S,You did the wrong half I thought it was yellow,280,nan,1
Session-2,T,One pink is the whole shape,281,0,nan
Session-2,T,Makes sense,281,1,nan
Session-2,T,Its kinda like doing puzzle work isnt it,281,1,nan
Session-2,T,Ross you had an awesome question,281,0,nan
Session-2,T,For number five what did you ask me,281,1,nan
Session-2,T,So Ross asked do I need to figure out what three pieces go on here,282,5,nan
Session-2,T,What three pieces would fit on a pink,282,5,nan
Session-2,T,Luke,282,1,nan
Session-2,S,The blue,283,nan,3
Session-2,T,The blue,284,3,nan
Session-2,T,The lightblue,284,1,nan
Session-2,S,Three blues on two yellows,285,nan,3
Session-2,T,Does that work,286,1,nan
Session-2,T,So if thats 34 how many more of those light blues do I need to make the whole shape,286,5,nan
Session-2,S,One,287,nan,3
Session-2,T,Well do I have anything thats that shape,288,1,nan
Session-2,S,No,289,nan,0
Session-2,T,Do I have one pink and one light blue,290,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yes,291,nan,0
Session-2,T,I do,292,4,nan
Session-2,T,So in my answer I have one pink plus one light blue,292,0,nan
Session-2,T,Please dont freak out about this is no something youre going to have to do very often because do we all carry fraction circles in our pockets,292,1,nan
Session-2,S,No,293,nan,0
Session-2,T,Theyre just trying to get you to understand that the whole changes,294,0,nan
Session-2,T,A whole might be a group of things,294,0,nan
Session-2,T,It might be one full circle,294,0,nan
Session-2,T,It might be part of another,294,0,nan
Session-2,T,What we would consider a shape,294,0,nan
Session-2,T,Right now this is a whole thing,294,0,nan
Session-2,T,Lets pretend were buying a new couch like a fancy aerodynamic couch,294,0,nan
Session-2,T,This might be the whole shape of the couch,294,0,nan
Session-2,T,And we want 34 of it to be in white leather and the other 14 in a different color leather,294,0,nan
Session-2,S,Red,295,nan,0
Session-2,T,Red leather okay,296,1,nan
Session-2,T,So that whole is not a full circle but we would still have to be able to figure out a fraction of it,296,0,nan
Session-2,T,Okay so right now we have 34 plus one more 14 to give us our whole okay,296,1,nan
Session-2,T,Ross,296,1,nan
Session-2,T,How did you do it,297,5,nan
Session-2,S,So we need one of the light blue ones so one of them,298,nan,4
Session-2,S,We put two of the dark blue ones and then one purple,298,nan,4
Session-2,T,So you found different ways to fill up,299,0,nan
Session-2,T,Interesting interesting interesting,299,0,nan
Session-2,T,Anyone disagree or see how they did that,299,2,nan
Session-2,T,What would that fraction be,299,5,nan
Session-2,T,Thats confusing isnt it,299,1,nan
Session-2,T,If you had to name that fraction that would be hard to do wouldnt it,299,1,nan
Session-2,S,Yeah,300,nan,0
Session-2,T,Because theyre not equal parts there,301,0,nan
Session-2,T,That would be tricky,301,0,nan
Session-2,T,All right,301,0,nan
Session-2,T,Please make sure you grab a homework,301,0,nan
Session-2,T,You need a template for homework,301,0,nan
Session-2,T,So you may take a template home,301,0,nan
Session-2,T,You may take a template home but you have to make sure it to be back,301,0,nan
Session-3,T,All right you ready,1,1,nan
Session-3,T,Close up your journal for now,1,0,nan
Session-3,S,Testing testing,2,nan,0
Session-3,S,One two three,2,nan,0
Session-3,T,All right problem,3,0,nan
Session-3,T,The first problem the pink problem,3,0,nan
Session-3,T,Julie will you read that out loud for me please,3,1,nan
Session-3,S,Diana has five beets Kennedy has seven times as many beets as Diana,4,nan,0
Session-3,S,How many beets does Kennedy have,4,nan,0
Session-3,T,What do we need to find out,5,5,nan
Session-3,T,Leo what do we need to find out,5,5,nan
Session-3,S,How many beets Kennedy has,6,nan,3
Session-3,T,What do we know,7,5,nan
Session-3,T,What pieces do we know,7,5,nan
Session-3,T,Quinn,7,1,nan
Session-3,S,That Diana has five beets and Kennedy has seven times that,8,nan,3
Session-3,T,How are we going to write a number sentence to show us how to solve that go ahead Kenzie,9,5,nan
Session-3,S,5 times 7,10,nan,3
Session-3,T,How many does Kennedy have,11,5,nan
Session-3,S,nan,12,nan,3
Session-3,T,So five represents whose beets,13,5,nan
Session-3,T,Seven represents,15,5,nan
Session-3,S,Kennedy,16,nan,3
Session-3,S,No the multiple,17,nan,1
Session-3,T,The number of times more beets,18,4,nan
Session-3,T,What does 35 represent,18,5,nan
Session-3,S,Kennedys,19,nan,3
Session-3,T,All right,20,0,nan
Session-3,T,Carson will you read the green problem for us please,20,1,nan
Session-3,S,Ellie has a small ball made of 20 feet of string a large ball of string has 30 times as many feet of string,21,nan,0
Session-3,S,How many feet of string is in the large one,21,nan,0
Session-3,T,What do we need to find out Mason,22,5,nan
Session-3,S,We need to find out what 20 times 30 is,23,nan,3
Session-3,T,We need to find out what 20 times 30 is how do you know that,24,5,nan
Session-3,S,Because it says 30 so theres 20 feet of string and a large ball of string has 30 times as many,25,nan,4
Session-3,T,So those clue words helped you figure out what you needed to do okay,26,0,nan
Session-3,T,Mason says we need to do 20 times 30,26,0,nan
Session-3,T,What does the 20 represent Emery,26,5,nan
Session-3,S,Ellies,27,nan,3
Session-3,T,Ellies is it necessarily important that Ellie owns that or are we talking about different sizes,28,5,nan
Session-3,S,Different sizes,29,nan,3
Session-3,T,At first I was like Well who has the bigger ball of string,30,0,nan
Session-3,T,It doesnt matter who has it were talking about the size of the ball of string,30,0,nan
Session-3,T,Ellies is what size,30,5,nan
Session-3,S,20 feet,31,nan,3
Session-3,T,The smaller one which is 20 feet,32,4,nan
Session-3,T,A larger one has 30 feet,32,1,nan
Session-3,S,No 30 times as,33,nan,3
Session-3,T,30 times,34,3,nan
Session-3,T,Mason I agree with you that you would do 20 times 30,34,0,nan
Session-3,T,Anyone add 30,34,1,nan
Session-3,T,No,34,1,nan
Session-3,T,Awesome,34,0,nan
Session-3,T,What is our answer there,34,5,nan
Session-3,S,nan,35,nan,3
Session-3,T,600,36,1,nan
Session-3,T,600 represents what,36,5,nan
Session-3,S,The larger ball of string,37,nan,3
Session-3,T,More specific please,38,5,nan
Session-3,S,30 times,39,nan,3
Session-3,S,30 times as many as the small ball of string,40,nan,1
Session-3,T,600 represents you said the ball of string,41,0,nan
Session-3,S,The larger,42,nan,3
Session-3,T,600 ball of string,43,1,nan
Session-3,S,The larger ball of string,44,nan,3
Session-3,T,Whats our unit of measure,45,5,nan
Session-3,T,What are we measuring with,45,5,nan
Session-3,S,Feet,46,nan,3
Session-3,T,Feet in the,47,5,nan
Session-3,S,Large ball,48,nan,3
Session-3,T,Thank you 600 feet in the larger ball of string,49,4,nan
Session-3,T,This one was a little more tricky because it put it in a different order for you it didnt give you the problem to start with it gave you the total to start with,49,0,nan
Session-3,T,Matthew oh sorry Im going to have someone else read it,49,0,nan
Session-3,T,Levi would you be willing to read the blue problem,49,1,nan
Session-3,S,Matthew and his older brother Jason were eating grapes,50,nan,0
Session-3,S,Jason ate 54 grapes which is 9 times as many as Matthew,50,nan,0
Session-3,S,How many did Matthew eat,50,nan,0
Session-3,T,We know how much Jason ate and that that number is nine times many as Matthew,51,0,nan
Session-3,T,Evan talk me through that,51,5,nan
Session-3,S,All you have to do is you have to find out how much Matthew ate and how you do that is you do 9 times something equals 54,52,nan,3
Session-3,T,So our unknown is how many Matthew ate because it tells us how much Jason ate and that that is equal to nine times something,53,4,nan
Session-3,T,Did anyone do it in a different order,53,2,nan
Session-3,T,Bryson how did you do yours,53,5,nan
Session-3,S,549,54,nan,3
Session-3,T,You did a division problem,55,1,nan
Session-3,T,You just worked it backwards we know the opposite function of multiplication is division which is basically saying this what number times 9 will give me 54,55,0,nan
Session-3,T,If you know your multiplication facts you know that 6 times 9 equals 54,55,0,nan
Session-3,T,So how many did Matthew eat,55,5,nan
Session-3,S,Six,56,nan,3
Session-3,T,Six what,57,5,nan
Session-3,S,Grapes,58,nan,3
Session-3,T,Next part,59,0,nan
Session-3,T,Ratica ate 13 of a small peach tart did anyone draw pictures for this,59,1,nan
Session-3,T,Nobody drew pictures to help them view it,59,1,nan
Session-3,T,Okay,59,0,nan
Session-3,T,For me its much easier to draw pictures remember that 13 looks like a peace sign when we do it as a circle,59,0,nan
Session-3,T,If Ratica ate 13 of a peach tart and Brianna ate 13 of another peach tart with the same size I need to draw another peach tart and Brianna ate 13,59,0,nan
Session-3,T,How much did the girls eat together,59,5,nan
Session-3,S,Two,60,nan,3
Session-3,T,Miles what did you say,61,1,nan
Session-3,S,I thought the girls ate together was 23 because the bottom numbers stay the same but you add the two top numbers,62,nan,4
Session-3,T,So you said that together they ate 23 because each of them ate Participate with me please come on,63,4,nan
Session-3,T,Each of them ate 13 so you added them together,63,0,nan
Session-3,T,Can anyone else explain that in a different way,63,2,nan
Session-3,T,Mason,63,1,nan
Session-3,S,I also  they ate together so it says that Brianna ate 13 of another peach tart so its 2 peach tarts in total,64,nan,4
Session-3,S,What they did is they ate one of the 13 from one and then they ate another 13 from another so 23,64,nan,4
Session-3,T,You did the same math basically but thought of it as 13 of one peach tart and 13 of another peach tart,65,4,nan
Session-3,T,Did anyone happen to view 26 as their answer,65,1,nan
Session-3,T,Okay if you did 26 I want you to think about that for a minute,65,0,nan
Session-3,T,What does the bottom number of a fraction mean,65,5,nan
Session-3,T,Liam,65,1,nan
Session-3,S,What the whole is,66,nan,3
Session-3,T,What the whole is So you think that the bottom number shows you how many are in the whole,67,1,nan
Session-3,S,It shows you how many,68,nan,3
Session-3,T,Okay add on to that or help clarify that a little bit Wes,69,2,nan
Session-3,S,How many pieces there are,70,nan,3
Session-3,T,How many pieces there are total in that whole thing thats being split up,71,4,nan
Session-3,T,Our bottom number should tell us how many total pieces there are in the whole,71,0,nan
Session-3,T,Leo I have a question for you,71,0,nan
Session-3,S,What,72,nan,0
Session-3,T,Were there six pieces in the whole,73,1,nan
Session-3,T,How do we know there werent six pieces in the whole,73,5,nan
Session-3,T,Because they ate what,73,5,nan
Session-3,S,13,74,nan,3
Session-3,T,13 that bottom number tells us how many total pieces there are in the whole,75,4,nan
Session-3,T,This is Raticas whole this is Briannas whole there were two separate wholes that we were talking about but Ratica ate her part of her whole Brianna ate her part of her whole but together they ate this much,75,0,nan
Session-3,T,We have to ask ourselves how many total pieces were there in the whole,75,5,nan
Session-3,T,Raticas had three Briannas had three,75,0,nan
Session-3,T,Thats why we dont switch it to become six does that makes sense to you,75,1,nan
Session-3,T,Declan does that make sense to you,75,1,nan
Session-3,T,Okay,75,0,nan
Session-3,T,I have another question wait a second,75,0,nan
Session-3,T,I have another question,75,0,nan
Session-3,T,Lets pretend that Briannas tart is much larger,75,0,nan
Session-3,T,Raticas tart is about as big as your hands you can go it together in a circle and lets say that Briannas tart is as big as your arms can go in a circle,75,0,nan
Session-3,S,Yes,76,nan,0
Session-3,T,The hands versus arms,77,0,nan
Session-3,T,What the total amount of what they ate,77,5,nan
Session-3,T,Would our answers still be the same if they ate 23,77,1,nan
Session-3,S,I would give the one for you like,78,nan,0
Session-3,T,Brandon I see you shaking your head how come,79,6,nan
Session-3,S,Because if theyre human size you cant compete with them because the,80,nan,4
Session-3,T,Okay,81,0,nan
Session-3,T,If I said a 14 of my class is going on a field trip and then we compare that to 14 of a class that has 10 kids would it be the same number of kids going on a field trip,81,1,nan
Session-3,S,No,82,nan,0
Session-3,T,No,83,3,nan
Session-3,T,Our wholes have to be the same if were going to compare them like that okay,83,1,nan
Session-3,T,Nice job explaining that,83,0,nan
Session-3,T,All right lets look at our math Journal pages come on come one,83,0,nan
Session-3,T,It is page 159,83,0,nan
Session-3,T,nan,83,0,nan
Session-3,S,What page,84,nan,0
Session-3,T,nan,85,0,nan
Session-3,T,These are those numbers  but we have to really accurately read to help us understand,86,0,nan
Session-3,T,Were just going to cut and break down what each problem says then you guys work on fully,86,0,nan
Session-3,T,For number one Michael will you read us the problem for number one,86,1,nan
Session-3,S,Yes,87,nan,0
Session-3,T,Okay were going to visualize Ryan and his three sisters how many people are working,88,5,nan
Session-3,S,Four,89,nan,3
Session-3,T,Four people because its Ryan and his three sisters,90,4,nan
Session-3,T,Four people are working,90,0,nan
Session-3,T,They are working to paint,90,0,nan
Session-3,T,Ryan has his bucket of paint and he is going to use how much of his paint,90,5,nan
Session-3,S,23,91,nan,3
Session-3,T,23 each so theres one of their problem the 23 then each of his sisters so theres three more people,92,4,nan
Session-3,T,Theyre each going to use 13 of their cans,92,0,nan
Session-3,T,These cans are all the same size so we know were not comparing cans to cans,92,0,nan
Session-3,T,Were trying to figure out how much they used altogether,92,0,nan
Session-3,T,What is the whole thing that were working with,92,5,nan
Session-3,T,What are we breaking into whole Declan,92,5,nan
Session-3,T,Well the whole thing is cut into third but what is the third Leo,92,5,nan
Session-3,S,A can of paint,93,nan,3
Session-3,T,A can of paint okay so your whole is a can of paint,94,4,nan
Session-3,T,You have room to draw if you want to you have room to just write number models if you want to,94,0,nan
Session-3,T,Can you please talk through how we know what were going to put in our number model,94,5,nan
Session-3,T,What are we going to add together in our number model,94,5,nan
Session-3,T,Xander what things do you think you are going to add in your number model,94,5,nan
Session-3,S,I think Im going to add 23  13  13  13,95,nan,3
Session-3,T,All right can you please tell me what 23 represents,96,5,nan
Session-3,S,How much paint he used,97,nan,3
Session-3,T,Okay thats Ryans can of paint that he used,98,4,nan
Session-3,T,He used 23 of it and what is each of these 13 represents,98,5,nan
Session-3,S,How much his sisters used,99,nan,3
Session-3,T,Sister one sister two and sister three thank you,100,0,nan
Session-3,T,Is your number going to be an improper fraction,100,1,nan
Session-3,T,What does an improper fraction mean Esther,100,5,nan
Session-3,S,Its  over the whole but its more,101,nan,3
Session-3,T,Its more than a whole right,102,1,nan
Session-3,T,Our top number our numerator will be larger than our denominator which means thats more than one whole,102,0,nan
Session-3,S,Like 65,103,nan,3
Session-3,T,Feel free to draw feel free to figure out both in improper fraction and mixed number fraction if you want to,104,0,nan
Session-3,T,Everyone understand how to get to where you need to be on that one,104,1,nan
Session-3,S,Yes,105,nan,0
Session-3,T,Because Im going to erase that,106,0,nan
Session-3,T,Are you good,106,1,nan
Session-3,S,Yes,107,nan,0
Session-3,T,All right let me just get this for our problem number two,108,0,nan
Session-3,T,This persons name is Charice Emery would you please read that aloud to us,108,1,nan
Session-3,T,Her name is Charice,108,0,nan
Session-3,S,Ally and Charice both want to stay in shape,109,nan,0
Session-3,S,On Saturday Ally ran 38 of a mile more than Charice Charice ran 78 of a mile,109,nan,0
Session-3,S,How far has Ally run,109,nan,0
Session-3,T,Okay we need to really dissect what we know,110,0,nan
Session-3,T,How far did Charice ran,110,5,nan
Session-3,S,78,111,nan,3
Session-3,T,78 right,112,1,nan
Session-3,T,Charice ran 78 of a mile,112,0,nan
Session-3,T,What do we have to find out,112,5,nan
Session-3,T,We needed to find out how much Ally ran right Eric,112,1,nan
Session-3,S,Yes,113,nan,0
Session-3,T,How do we find that out,114,5,nan
Session-3,T,What information did they give us Felicity to help us figure that out,114,6,nan
Session-3,S,Ally and Charice both run to stay shape,115,nan,0
Session-3,S,On Saturday Ally ran 38 and,115,nan,0
Session-3,T,Read that carefully students,116,1,nan
Session-3,T,Just recreate she ran 38,116,5,nan
Session-3,S,of a mile more than Charice,117,nan,0
Session-3,T,Okay we know how far has Charice ran we know that Ally ran 38 more than her,118,0,nan
Session-3,T,Will we be adding or subtracting,118,5,nan
Session-3,S,Subtracting,119,nan,3
Session-3,S,Adding,120,nan,1
Session-3,T,Who said adding at that table,121,1,nan
Session-3,S,Me and,122,nan,0
Session-3,T,Eric why are we going to add onto this,123,6,nan
Session-3,S,It says more and if you say less then were going to be subtracting it,124,nan,4
Session-3,T,Number story problems they give you those clue words,125,0,nan
Session-3,T,A lot of times it asks you how many more and thats when we subtract but this ones telling that we know this and then this person ran much farther or that much more of a fraction of a mile,125,0,nan
Session-3,T,A lot of times when we hear more we do subtraction and in this case Eric you and whoever else in your table I heard a couple of people say Youre going to add we would be adding that on to okay,125,1,nan
Session-3,T,What is the whole thing that were counting,125,5,nan
Session-3,S,Miles,126,nan,3
Session-3,T,What Lila,127,1,nan
Session-3,S,Miles,128,nan,3
Session-3,T,Miles,129,3,nan
Session-3,T,A mile,129,0,nan
Session-3,T,One mile is the whole,129,0,nan
Session-3,T,Theyre breaking that mile into parts,129,0,nan
Session-3,T,You feel like you can figure that one out now without me even writing the number model for you Beckett,129,1,nan
Session-3,S,No,130,nan,0
Session-3,S,We have to,130,nan,0
Session-3,T,Okay,131,0,nan
Session-3,T,Ill now let you guys do it,131,0,nan
Session-3,T,Once you guys are done working on your problems then well come back together and talk about them,131,0,nan
Session-3,T,Make sure that when you answer it you tell that youre focusing on what your measurement is,131,0,nan
Session-3,T,Down at the bottom you have some fractions that youre adding together,131,0,nan
Session-3,T,They look really different than something weve ever seen before,131,0,nan
Session-3,T,All right the denominators of all of those the things,131,0,nan
Session-3,S,Yes,132,nan,0
Session-3,T,Do I add the denominators together,133,1,nan
Session-3,S,No,134,nan,0
Session-3,T,Anyone know why we dont add the denominators together,135,6,nan
Session-3,T,going up,135,0,nan
Session-3,T,Mason why dont we add the denominators together,135,6,nan
Session-3,S,Because then we would add two wholes,136,nan,4
Session-3,T,Yes were just talking about if this part is cut into this many pieces and we are talking about this many of them and another whole is cut into this many pieces and were only talking about How many total parts of the whole would we be adding together,137,5,nan
Session-3,T,We dont then cut it into that many more pieces does that make sense,137,1,nan
Session-3,T,Remember that our denominators is how many total pieces the whole is cut into,137,0,nan
Session-3,T,Down here we have something cut into 10 equal parts were going to focus on two of them,137,0,nan
Session-3,T,That whole is still cut into 10 equal parts and were going to add 5 more pieces to it,137,0,nan
Session-3,T,Think about your pie at Thanksgiving time way back three months ago,138,0,nan
Session-3,T,Lets say that it was cut into 10 equal pieces,138,0,nan
Session-3,T,On Thanksgiving you ate 2 of them and the day after Thanksgiving you ate 5 more of them,138,0,nan
Session-3,T,The pie pieces didnt change shape they were still 10 pieces you ate 2 of them one day and 5 another so you still have out of those 10,138,0,nan
Session-3,T,Same thing here same thing here,138,0,nan
Session-3,T,You have this page to work on and decimal review on the next page,138,0,nan
Session-3,S,We still have,138,nan,0
Session-3,T,Oh thank you I forgot I used my marker on it instead of pencil thank you,139,0,nan
Session-3,T,You have decimal review so youre going to think about these are tenths these are hundreds there goes my cage coloring in your grid to match these are tenths,139,0,nan
Session-3,T,Look back at your place value chart place the following decimals on the number line you need to place 82100 and 29100 write each decimal as a fraction each of those two,139,0,nan
Session-3,T,Write them in words use your place value chart for that,139,0,nan
Session-3,T,Remember you say a whole number then you say What word do you say with a decimal,139,5,nan
Session-3,T,When you see a decimal you say,139,5,nan
Session-3,S,And,140,nan,3
Session-3,T,And,141,3,nan
Session-3,T,All right Im going to let you work together lets come back together in 30 minutes to go over the two fraction problems review our decimal,141,0,nan
Session-3,T,If you have time to do math boxes that would be fabulous if you are done with all of that you may play math games and Ill let you pick what you want,141,0,nan
Session-3,T,No because were going to come back together I dont want to worry about getting it off the way,141,0,nan
Session-3,T,Whyd you get these numbers for,142,6,nan
Session-3,T,No were playing math games  and youre done with all three of those tables,142,0,nan
Session-3,S,Yes,143,nan,0
Session-3,S,Do you need this,143,nan,0
Session-3,T,need to calm down,144,0,nan
Session-3,T,If you were not done with page 60 at 800 or 920 youll stay through recess to get it done,144,0,nan
Session-3,T,also need to get done,144,0,nan
Session-3,S,30 minutes to recess I cant wait,145,nan,0
Session-3,T,in 20 minutes,146,0,nan
Session-3,T,What are you doing,146,5,nan
Session-3,S,Were doing multiplication  because thats not enough time  multiplication facts,147,nan,0
Session-3,T,Okay,148,0,nan
Session-3,T,If there is a microphone near you where you were working,148,0,nan
Session-3,S,We got ours,149,nan,0
Session-3,S,Put it on now,150,nan,0
Session-3,S,Wait,150,nan,0
Session-3,S,We have one,150,nan,0
Session-3,T,Okay,151,0,nan
Session-3,T,In problem number one were on the  problems page,151,0,nan
Session-3,T,All of you need to have your math journal out so that you can help describe and explain and justify what you did the math,151,0,nan
Session-3,T,Max what was the whole thing that we were trying to talk about when we are talking about our fractions with the whole,151,5,nan
Session-3,T,A can of paint right,152,1,nan
Session-3,T,Just one can of paint  thats what were splitting into parts,152,0,nan
Session-3,T,All right so we had said Ryan used 23 each of his sisters and there were three of them used a 13 and that was a total amount of paint that they used okay,152,1,nan
Session-3,T,Dilly and I drew a picture so Dilly will you describe never mind dont describe since I did it with you,152,0,nan
Session-3,T,Anyone else draw pictures,152,1,nan
Session-3,T,Quinn describe to me what you drew to help you solve this problem,152,5,nan
Session-3,T,Okay so there were four cans of paint,153,0,nan
Session-3,S,So we put them all in 23 and the first one which I believe two of,154,nan,3
Session-3,T,Thats Ryan,155,0,nan
Session-3,S,The second and the rest,156,nan,3
Session-3,T,Okay so this would be sister one sister two sister three,157,0,nan
Session-3,T,Are we adding together whole things,157,1,nan
Session-3,T,Are we adding together whole cans of paint,157,1,nan
Session-3,T,How many whole cans of paint did they use,157,5,nan
Session-3,T,Declan,157,1,nan
Session-3,S,One,158,nan,3
Session-3,T,I asked you a yes or no question,159,0,nan
Session-3,T,Are we adding together whole cans of paint,159,1,nan
Session-3,S,Yes,160,nan,0
Session-3,T,Is that were counting at,161,1,nan
Session-3,S,No no,162,nan,0
Session-3,T,Where are we counting at,163,5,nan
Session-3,S,Part of paint,164,nan,3
Session-3,T,How many parts of paint where we cut it into,165,5,nan
Session-3,S,Thirds,166,nan,3
Session-3,T,We cut it into thirds,167,1,nan
Session-3,T,Were adding up thirds,167,4,nan
Session-3,T,Thats how they split each of their cans of paint,167,0,nan
Session-3,T,Cut them into three equal parts,167,0,nan
Session-3,T,We are adding up thirds so the easiest way to do this is to start counting by thirds,167,0,nan
Session-3,T,Count with me,167,0,nan
Session-3,S,13 23 33 43 53,168,nan,0
Session-3,T,Right now we know 53 of cans of paint were used,169,0,nan
Session-3,T,Where we add together Ryan his first sister his second sister and his third sister,169,0,nan
Session-3,T,They together used 53 cans of paint,169,0,nan
Session-3,T,How many thirds does it take to make a whole can of paint,169,5,nan
Session-3,S,Three,170,nan,3
Session-3,T,Three of them,171,4,nan
Session-3,T,If I take three of those thirds and combine it all into one how many thirds is still being in this problem Declan,171,5,nan
Session-3,S,We still have 23,172,nan,3
Session-3,T,Yes,173,0,nan
Session-3,S,Yes,174,nan,0
Session-3,T,These two things are equal,175,0,nan
Session-3,T,53 is the improper fraction way of writing it,175,0,nan
Session-3,T,1 23 is the mixed number,175,0,nan
Session-3,T,You know that 33 makes one full can of paint,175,0,nan
Session-3,T,Four five theres two more thirds left,175,0,nan
Session-3,T,Makes sense,175,1,nan
Session-3,S,Yes,176,nan,0
Session-3,T,Did everyone get that answer in our problem,177,1,nan
Session-3,S,Yes,178,nan,0
Session-3,T,Okay,179,0,nan
Session-3,T,Lets switch to problem two,179,0,nan
Session-3,T,All right we decided one mile was a whole,179,0,nan
Session-3,T,Dilly and I drew a number line to help us with this we drew out miles,179,0,nan
Session-3,T,If this is zero mile this is one mile this is two miles what should each mile be split into,179,5,nan
Session-3,T,What fraction,179,5,nan
Session-3,T,How many parts,179,5,nan
Session-3,T,One person knows,179,0,nan
Session-3,T,Maria how many parts should we cut our miles into,179,5,nan
Session-3,T,How many equal parts,179,5,nan
Session-3,S,Eight,180,nan,3
Session-3,T,Eight okay,181,4,nan
Session-3,T,Theres eight there,181,0,nan
Session-3,T,An eight there,181,0,nan
Session-3,T,Why do we cut them into eight equal parts,181,6,nan
Session-3,T,How do you know that Julie,181,5,nan
Session-3,S,Because eight is the common parts in mile,182,nan,4
Session-3,T,Okay,183,0,nan
Session-3,T,Does this tell us right here,183,1,nan
Session-3,S,Yes,184,nan,0
Session-3,T,That bottom number shows us how parts of whole is cut into,185,0,nan
Session-3,T,Our denominator tells us that we dont even have to try that figure it out,185,0,nan
Session-3,T,Caden how far did Charice ran,185,5,nan
Session-3,S,78,186,nan,3
Session-3,T,78,187,3,nan
Session-3,T,18 28 38 48 58 68 78,187,0,nan
Session-3,T,This is where Charice ran,187,0,nan
Session-3,T,How much farther than Charice did Ally ran Xander,187,5,nan
Session-3,S,She ran 38 farther,188,nan,3
Session-3,T,Yes,189,0,nan
Session-3,T,If I start at Charice I need to go how many more eighths,189,5,nan
Session-3,S,Three,190,nan,3
Session-3,T,One two three,191,4,nan
Session-3,T,This is where Ally ran,191,0,nan
Session-3,T,I need to figure out what that fraction is okay,191,0,nan
Session-3,T,I ran or Charice ran 78 Allys going to add on 38 to her distance we need to figure out how far that is,191,0,nan
Session-3,T,When Dilly and I worked this problem we literally just counted eighths,191,0,nan
Session-3,T,We went 18 28 38 48 58 68 78 88 98 108 or you could pay attention to the whole number,191,0,nan
Session-3,T,This was one whole mile and there were two more eights after that so she ran one whole mile and 28 of the next mile,191,0,nan
Session-3,T,Did she run more than a mile or less than a mile,191,5,nan
Session-3,S,More,192,nan,3
Session-3,T,How did you solve that problem Brandon,193,5,nan
Session-3,T,Did you use something different,193,1,nan
Session-3,S,No,194,nan,0
Session-3,T,You drew a number line like that,195,5,nan
Session-3,S,Well I sort of thought the same thing but I actually did all,196,nan,1
Session-3,T,Youre on your decimal page no wonder why youre confused,197,0,nan
Session-3,T,Can you switch to the fraction page,197,0,nan
Session-3,T,Where did you do to figure out how far Ally ran,197,5,nan
Session-3,S,I did it up by doing three  by adding the top numbers because you cant add the bottom number with 10 so,198,nan,4
Session-3,T,So you just did the actual number model problem instead of drawing a picture,199,0,nan
Session-3,T,Did anyone else draw a picture,199,2,nan
Session-3,T,Nobody drew square or circles cut into tenths,199,1,nan
Session-3,T,That tells me that youre remembering the rules of when denominators are the same you may add the numerators,199,0,nan
Session-3,T,As Im walking around all of you did that all of just did the number model I dont see any pictures,199,0,nan
Session-3,T,Any questions on that,199,1,nan
Session-3,T,Declan you have question,199,1,nan
Session-3,S,Not a question but I guess  if you added the numerators if you wanted 216 would that be,200,nan,3
Session-3,T,Yes,201,0,nan
Session-3,T,Okay and the bottom ones are pretty simple right,201,1,nan
Session-3,S,Yes,202,nan,0
Session-3,T,Okay all right turn to the next page,203,0,nan
Session-4,T,Okay you ready,1,1,nan
Session-4,T,We are going to try various strategies to add mixed numbers that have denominators who can remind us what a mixed number is,1,5,nan
Session-4,T,Compared to an improper fraction those two things we touched about yesterday mixed number compared to an improper fraction,1,0,nan
Session-4,T,Jeremy remembers Georgia remembers Kyle remembers,1,0,nan
Session-4,T,Theres more stuff you can just put them right here on there thank you,2,0,nan
Session-4,T,Yes thats full,2,0,nan
Session-4,T,Anyone else has a  folder,2,0,nan
Session-4,T,I dont have pink sheets but Ill put them in because I havent done it yet,2,0,nan
Session-4,T,If you did not turn in your  folder go do it now please,2,0,nan
Session-4,T,Okay mixed number Nick do you think you remember what a mixed number is,2,5,nan
Session-4,S,I think its a number that I forgot,2,nan,0
Session-4,T,What do you think Cooper,3,5,nan
Session-4,S,I think its like an uneven fraction with the denominator  and its like an uneven number with an even number as a denominator and you have to break it down to something that,4,nan,4
Session-4,T,You mean uneven as in odd,5,1,nan
Session-4,T,What do you mean when you say uneven,5,5,nan
Session-4,S,Like that thing when you did like last time when we had two even fractions with one and then ten,6,nan,0
Session-4,T,Cameron can you add on or clarify or explaining what youre thinking,7,5,nan
Session-4,S,I think mixed numbers mixed fractions are,8,nan,0
Session-4,T,Mixed numbers you were right,9,4,nan
Session-4,S,Its like one and one half or one and three thirds or something like that,10,nan,3
Session-4,T,Its a mix of a whole number and a fraction so one and a half or three and two fourths or ten and a third,11,4,nan
Session-4,T,It has whole numbers to it and fractions to it Cameron good way to explain that,11,0,nan
Session-4,T,Mixed number is a mix of wholes and parts,11,0,nan
Session-4,T,Were going to add those today it might be if I have one and a third cups of blueberries and I pour it into another cup and two thirds how many cups do I have altogether,11,5,nan
Session-4,T,Were going to figure out two different ways to solve problems when youre adding mixed numbers you got it when you can determine what the whole is youve got it when you can generate a number model with unknowns and you can solve that mixed number story problem accurately,11,0,nan
Session-4,T,Questions on those,11,1,nan
Session-4,T,Youre a mental math today,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,Youre writing decimals use your place value chart on your name tag if you need it how do you write onetenth or how many wholes theyre in onetenth,12,5,nan
Session-4,T,Zero,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,Onetenth think about how you say that what place is that one going to go in use your place value chart threetenths ninetenths twohundredths ninehundredths or 80 hundredths and then we have mixed numbers two and 13 hundredths nine and 56 hundredths 12 and 87 hundredths,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,Pick one from each color then math,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,Solve using your fraction circle pieces or the number line poster,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,You also have a number line poster in math journal number one you can use that,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,Two and onefourth is the same thing as how many fourths,12,5,nan
Session-4,T,Youre taking a mixed number and youre converting it into an improper fraction,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,If you have two whole ones and a fourth how many fourths would that be altogether,12,5,nan
Session-4,T,Think think think,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,One pink one green one blue,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,Think through that problem Ill give you about 10 minutes,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,Why are you eating candy right now,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,Put the  away please,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,Do that first one and then 12 so I think it should be one and how many whole numbers do I have,12,5,nan
Session-4,T,Did  somethings  and or just onetenth,12,5,nan
Session-4,T,Onetenth,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,I have whole numbers tenths and onehundredths,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,Where would I put onetenth,12,5,nan
Session-4,T,said one or did I say onetenth and then theres nothing here because I didnt say two and onetenth or five and  two onehundredths or twohundredths,12,0,nan
Session-4,T,Where do I put the,12,5,nan
Session-4,T,If I have that there  13hundredths where do I put the two,12,5,nan
Session-4,T,People are drawing pictures to help them with that math message problem thats a good idea,13,0,nan
Session-4,T,Give you about another minute and a half or so,13,0,nan
Session-4,T,One more minute,14,0,nan
Session-4,T,Okay,14,0,nan
Session-4,T,If you are working in your Math journal on Math boxes close it up please,14,0,nan
Session-4,T,Help your teammate set their table if they didnt hear that direction,14,0,nan
Session-4,T,All right,14,0,nan
Session-4,T,How many of you use the place value flip chart rather than writing up here all the different place values in their columns,14,1,nan
Session-4,T,Who did the first pink problem,14,1,nan
Session-4,T,Onetenth,14,0,nan
Session-4,T,Okay Brian,14,0,nan
Session-4,T,Tell me what I should have as my decimal,14,5,nan
Session-4,S,For your decimal youve got zero,15,nan,3
Session-4,T,You start with zero whole ones,16,0,nan
Session-4,S,Zero whole one and onetenth and zero,17,nan,3
Session-4,T,I could have that blank,18,1,nan
Session-4,T,For the first decimal 01 is the same thing as zero and onetenth,18,4,nan
Session-4,T,Okay,18,0,nan
Session-4,T,Is it okay if I have that,18,1,nan
Session-4,S,Yes,19,nan,0
Session-4,S,Its okay,19,nan,0
Session-4,T,Is onetenth equal to 10 onehundredths,20,1,nan
Session-4,T,Who did the second pink problem,21,1,nan
Session-4,T,Ada tell me what I should have as my decimal,21,5,nan
Session-4,S,Zero ones and three tenths,22,nan,3
Session-4,T,Okay,23,0,nan
Session-4,T,Zero whole ones three tenths so 03,23,4,nan
Session-4,T,Is it okay to have 030,23,1,nan
Session-4,T,You can even do 0300,23,0,nan
Session-4,T,You could add a million zeroes on the end and it would still be three tenths because that is the only value,23,0,nan
Session-4,T,Everything else is nothing,23,0,nan
Session-4,T,Okay,23,0,nan
Session-4,T,How about the last pink one,23,5,nan
Session-4,T,Trey tell me what I need to have in the ones,23,5,nan
Session-4,S,In the ones you should have zero and in the tenths you should have nine and then the hundredths could be blank,24,nan,3
Session-4,T,Okay,25,0,nan
Session-4,T,Zero and ninetenths,25,0,nan
Session-4,T,Are we clear,25,1,nan
Session-4,T,Super duper awesome or no,25,1,nan
Session-4,T,Do we forget how to do this,25,1,nan
Session-4,T,Is that okay,25,1,nan
Session-4,T,Okay,25,0,nan
Session-4,T,All right,25,0,nan
Session-4,T,Now we are looking at hundredths,25,0,nan
Session-4,T,Im going to put this back to the beginning,25,0,nan
Session-4,T,Who did the first green problem,25,1,nan
Session-4,T,tell me what you did,25,5,nan
Session-4,S,I did zero zero and a two,26,nan,3
Session-4,T,Zero ones or zero whole ones,27,4,nan
Session-4,T,Are there any tenths in twohundredths,27,1,nan
Session-4,T,If you think back to our unifix cubes or our big ten blocks the little tiny cubes are the hundredths,27,0,nan
Session-4,T,How many longs do we have if we have two little cubes,27,5,nan
Session-4,T,We dont have any,29,0,nan
Session-4,T,002 is two hundredths,29,0,nan
Session-4,T,The second green problem,29,1,nan
Session-4,T,Who did the second green problem nine onehundredths,29,1,nan
Session-4,T,Jeremy what should I have,29,5,nan
Session-4,S,Zero point zero,30,nan,3
Session-4,T,Okay,31,0,nan
Session-4,T,009 or zero and nine hundredths,31,4,nan
Session-4,T,Last problem,31,0,nan
Session-4,T,Tricky tricky,31,0,nan
Session-4,T,Finn tell me what you wrote,31,5,nan
Session-4,S,8,32,nan,3
Session-4,T,You think back to little cubes,33,0,nan
Session-4,T,How many little cubes would I have if I had 80 hundredths,33,5,nan
Session-4,S,80 of them,34,nan,3
Session-4,T,80 of them,35,3,nan
Session-4,S,Or just 008,36,nan,3
Session-4,T,You are telling me I would have eight little cubes,37,4,nan
Session-4,T,We want this to say 80,37,0,nan
Session-4,T,80 hundredths is the same thing as,37,5,nan
Session-4,T,Okay,38,0,nan
Session-4,T,I want you to always picture when we are talking about tenths,38,0,nan
Session-4,T,Those are the longs,38,0,nan
Session-4,T,When we are talking about hundredths those are the little cubes,38,0,nan
Session-4,T,If you have 80 little cubes you really have you could combine them together it will be eight longs,38,0,nan
Session-4,T,Okay,38,0,nan
Session-4,T,If this were eight hundredths Finn you would have been correct,38,0,nan
Session-4,T,Do 008,38,0,nan
Session-4,T,Okay,38,0,nan
Session-4,T,All right,39,0,nan
Session-4,T,First blue problem,39,0,nan
Session-4,T,Who did two and 13 hundredths,39,1,nan
Session-4,T,Jude tell me what to do,39,5,nan
Session-4,S,What I did is I did zero and 26,39,nan,3
Session-4,T,Thats what you have,40,1,nan
Session-4,T,26,40,1,nan
Session-4,T,Kennedy read that to me as it is a decimal,40,5,nan
Session-4,S,Zero ones and 26 hundredths,41,nan,3
Session-4,T,Is that what we have,42,1,nan
Session-4,T,Zero ones,42,1,nan
Session-4,T,See how that number is a little bit bigger,42,1,nan
Session-4,T,Its hard to see when it is typed up on the board,42,0,nan
Session-4,T,Read that number to me Tucker,42,5,nan
Session-4,T,This one,42,0,nan
Session-4,T,Two,42,5,nan
Session-4,S,Two hundredths two ones,43,nan,3
Session-4,T,Two ones,44,3,nan
Session-4,T,Two,44,0,nan
Session-4,T,What do we say when we see the decimal,44,5,nan
Session-4,S,And,45,nan,3
Session-4,T,And,46,3,nan
Session-4,T,When you have a whole number and then a fraction after this is a mixed number,46,0,nan
Session-4,T,Two and how many hundredths do we want,46,5,nan
Session-4,S,nan,47,nan,3
Session-4,T,nan,48,3,nan
Session-4,T,Really well have 213,48,0,nan
Session-4,T,Two means the whole number,48,0,nan
Session-4,T,If the numbers bigger that is how many ones there are,48,0,nan
Session-4,T,Okay,48,0,nan
Session-4,T,What about nine and 56 hundredths,48,1,nan
Session-4,T,Byron,48,1,nan
Session-4,S,I did nine ones and 56 hundredths,49,nan,0
Session-4,T,Read it,50,5,nan
Session-4,T,Nine,50,5,nan
Session-4,T,Last one 12 and 87 hundredths,51,0,nan
Session-4,T,Graham,51,1,nan
Session-4,S,I put,52,nan,0
Session-4,T,I need a new column dont I,53,1,nan
Session-4,S,I put one in the tens column two in the ones column eight in the tens column and seven in the hundreds column,54,nan,4
Session-4,T,Okay,55,0,nan
Session-4,T,Read that now,55,5,nan
Session-4,S,12 and 87 hundredths,56,nan,3
Session-4,T,Try it again,57,5,nan
Session-4,S,12 and 87 hundredths,58,nan,3
Session-4,T,Okay,59,0,nan
Session-4,T,Think of that as money,59,0,nan
Session-4,T,That would be like 12 dollars and 87 cents,59,0,nan
Session-4,T,Okay,59,0,nan
Session-4,T,Thats that,59,0,nan
Session-4,T,Going back and spiraling back to things that weve practiced in the past,59,0,nan
Session-4,T,Not like it ever goes away my friends,59,0,nan
Session-4,T,We will continue practicing over and over,59,0,nan
Session-4,T,All right,59,0,nan
Session-4,T,Now to our math,59,0,nan
Session-4,T,You think fraction circles in your brain or drawing fraction circles or using that number line poster two and onefourths is equal to how many fourths,59,5,nan
Session-4,T,Only one person two people got that threefourths,59,0,nan
Session-4,T,Caleb what were you doing to help you figure that out,59,5,nan
Session-4,S,I used I knew that two get the whole numbers two was equal to two of them whole number of the denominator so I added four plus four which was eight,60,nan,4
Session-4,T,Why four plus four,61,6,nan
Session-4,T,Tell me more about that,61,6,nan
Session-4,S,Because the whole we had two wholes and the denominators four so we have to add that Because the denominator is a whole so to have four you need two wholes to have two quarters so I added four plus four which was eight and added the one that was in the fraction next to them,62,nan,4
Session-4,S,It was one whole which was nine out of the whole,62,nan,4
Session-4,T,I can follow your thinking however I still dont know that youve explained how you figured out four plus four where did you get four,63,5,nan
Session-4,T,You keep telling me the denominator is a four but we dont add denominators,63,0,nan
Session-4,T,Were talking about fourths,63,0,nan
Session-4,T,Tell me a little bit more about that,63,5,nan
Session-4,S,The denominator was the four thats the whole and since we have two wholes we have to have the wholes add to get Because at the top to have a whole it will need to be four out of four,64,nan,4
Session-4,T,Thank you thats what we were looking for,65,0,nan
Session-4,T,What is one whole if we cut it into four parts,65,5,nan
Session-4,T,How many fourths would that be,65,5,nan
Session-4,S,Four,66,nan,3
Session-4,T,Four,67,3,nan
Session-4,T,Thats what you are missing my dear friend,67,0,nan
Session-4,T,Fourfourths is one whole thing,67,0,nan
Session-4,T,So if we have one whole thing here and one whole thing here that takes care of the two whole things,67,0,nan
Session-4,T,We can add fourfourths plus another fourfourths and thats where Caleb got eight,67,0,nan
Session-4,T,We have eight fourths right now but are we done with all of our fourths,67,1,nan
Session-4,S,No,68,nan,0
Session-4,T,We have another Okay,69,1,nan
Session-4,T,We actually have how many total fourths,69,5,nan
Session-4,T,If we have fourfourths,69,5,nan
Session-4,S,Nine,70,nan,3
Session-4,T,plus fourfourths and another fourth,71,5,nan
Session-4,S,Nine,72,nan,3
Session-4,T,ninefourths,73,4,nan
Session-4,T,We just took a mixed number and turned it into an improper fraction,73,0,nan
Session-4,T,When your top number is bigger then your bottom number is called improper because its too heavy on top,73,0,nan
Session-4,T,Okay,73,0,nan
Session-4,T,Were going to practice a couple more,73,0,nan
Session-4,T,Does everyone understand where Caleb got fourfourths,73,2,nan
Session-4,T,And he added another fourfourths,75,2,nan
Session-4,S,Yes,76,nan,0
Session-4,T,If we had a picture this other fourth would look like that,77,0,nan
Session-4,T,Its fourfourths plus fourfourths plus one more fourth,77,0,nan
Session-4,T,Are they all the same shape pieces,77,1,nan
Session-4,T,What shape pieces are they,77,5,nan
Session-4,T,What fraction of a piece is it,77,5,nan
Session-4,S,Whole,78,nan,3
Session-4,T,Ready,80,1,nan
Session-4,T,Oh thats not it,80,0,nan
Session-4,T,How about this,80,0,nan
Session-4,T,Okay heres the new problem,80,0,nan
Session-4,T,Were going to turn it into a story problem,80,0,nan
Session-4,T,Jeff can you read that from where you are,80,1,nan
Session-4,S,Yes,81,nan,0
Session-4,T,Can you read that please,82,1,nan
Session-4,S,The cafeteria has had two threefifths of grape jelly and one onefifth tubs of strawberry jelly set aside for breakfast,83,nan,0
Session-4,S,How many tubes of jelly were there in all,83,nan,0
Session-4,T,Okay,84,0,nan
Session-4,T,Were starting with two and threefifths tubs of the jelly,84,0,nan
Session-4,T,Were adding another one and onefifth tubs of jelly okay,84,0,nan
Session-4,T,Clear off your whiteboard and do this problem with me please,84,0,nan
Session-4,T,Zach how many whole tubs of jelly do we have right here,84,5,nan
Session-4,S,Two,85,nan,3
Session-4,T,Two of them,86,4,nan
Session-4,T,Im going to draw myself two whole circles and I have another what fraction of a tub added to that,86,5,nan
Session-4,S,Threefifths,87,nan,3
Session-4,T,Threefifths,88,3,nan
Session-4,T,This other tub is going to be cut into five parts but I only have three of them,88,0,nan
Session-4,T,I almost have three but not quite,88,0,nan
Session-4,T,Okay and Im going to add another tub of strawberry because we have one whole and how many parts of another tub of strawberry jelly,88,5,nan
Session-4,T,What fraction,88,5,nan
Session-4,S,Onefifth,89,nan,3
Session-4,T,Another fifth,90,4,nan
Session-4,T,One more fifth,90,0,nan
Session-4,T,Right here I have two and threefifths,90,0,nan
Session-4,T,Im going to add one and onefifth,90,0,nan
Session-4,T,What could I start with to help me solve this problem,90,5,nan
Session-4,T,Elizabeth what could I start with to help me start solving this problem,90,5,nan
Session-4,S,You can add the two and the one together,91,nan,3
Session-4,T,I can start with the whole numbers,92,0,nan
Session-4,T,I know I have two whole tubs here and another whole tub here,92,4,nan
Session-4,T,How many whole tubs do I have,92,5,nan
Session-4,S,Three,93,nan,3
Session-4,T,Right now I have three full tubs of jelly,94,4,nan
Session-4,T,I can start with the whole numbers and those together,94,0,nan
Session-4,T,After I do that Preston what would I add next,94,5,nan
Session-4,S,You would add the,95,nan,0
Session-4,T,I took care of this part and I took care of this part,96,0,nan
Session-4,T,Whats left to work together or add together,96,0,nan
Session-4,S,Add the fractions,97,nan,3
Session-4,T,I could add the fractions together,98,0,nan
Session-4,T,Do I know how to add threefifths plus another fifth,98,1,nan
Session-4,S,Yes,99,nan,0
Session-4,T,Which will give me how many fifths,100,5,nan
Session-4,S,Fourfifths,101,nan,3
Session-4,T,Fourfifths,102,3,nan
Session-4,T,That is one way of to solve your problems start with the whole numbers like Elizabeths said and then add your fractional parts together,102,0,nan
Session-4,T,Here is another thing you can do that might be easier for some of you to figure out,102,0,nan
Session-4,S,Come on,103,nan,0
Session-4,T,Could I cut all my tubs of jelly into fifths,104,1,nan
Session-4,S,Yes,105,nan,0
Session-4,T,How many fifths is in a whole tub of jelly,106,5,nan
Session-4,S,Five,107,nan,3
Session-4,T,Fivefifths is one whole tub,108,4,nan
Session-4,T,Im talking about the whole fivefifths,108,0,nan
Session-4,T,That gives me two whole tubs of jelly plus another threefifths,108,0,nan
Session-4,T,How many fifths is in this full tub of jelly,108,5,nan
Session-4,S,Five,109,nan,3
Session-4,T,Five plus another how many right here,110,5,nan
Session-4,S,One,111,nan,3
Session-4,T,Could I add together fivefifths plus fivefifths plus threefifths plus fivefifths plus onefifth,112,1,nan
Session-4,S,Yes,113,nan,0
Session-4,T,Lets focus on our fives,114,0,nan
Session-4,T,Count the five,114,1,nan
Session-4,S,Five 10 15 16 17 18 19,115,nan,0
Session-4,S,19 fifths,116,nan,3
Session-4,T,Fifths,117,3,nan
Session-4,T,Its okay if you come up with an improper fraction for these problems,117,0,nan
Session-4,T,You can make them all out of equal parts and then add them together,117,0,nan
Session-4,S,You got to see the,118,nan,0
Session-4,T,These two things are equal,119,0,nan
Session-4,T,How many fives are there in 19,119,5,nan
Session-4,S,Five 10 15,119,nan,0
Session-4,T,Thats three whole ones,119,0,nan
Session-4,T,If I took 15 of those whole ones away whats 19 take those 15 away what am I left with,119,5,nan
Session-4,T,19 minus 15 is,119,5,nan
Session-4,S,Four,120,nan,3
Session-4,T,Those two things are equal it doesnt matter how you write them,121,0,nan
Session-4,T,Your turn,121,0,nan
Session-4,T,Youre going to do this,121,0,nan
Session-4,T,Try this one,121,0,nan
Session-4,T,Ben will you read that to us,121,1,nan
Session-4,T,Her name is Sophie,121,0,nan
Session-4,S,Sophie works at the deli,122,nan,0
Session-4,S,She sliced one and threeeighths pounds of ham and then stopped to help a customer,122,nan,0
Session-4,S,When she was done she sliced another two and seveneights of a pound,122,nan,0
Session-4,S,How many pounds of the ham did she,122,nan,0
Session-4,T,Tell me Cameron what is my number model going to look like,123,5,nan
Session-4,T,Whats my equation going to look like,123,5,nan
Session-4,S,One plus threeeighths plus two seveneights,124,nan,3
Session-4,T,Theres our number model with an unknown,125,0,nan
Session-4,T,You may do add the whole numbers first then add the fractions or you may turn then into improper fractions and then just add them together,125,0,nan
Session-4,T,When you think you have it would you please give me a thumbs up,125,1,nan
Session-4,T,Then Im going to throw a wrench in it for you,125,0,nan
Session-4,T,fraction,126,0,nan
Session-4,T,What happened to them,126,0,nan
Session-4,T,You have one full pound plus three more eighths,126,0,nan
Session-4,T,You have two more pounds plus seveneighths but you only end up with seven,126,1,nan
Session-4,T,Im going to ask you how you got that,127,0,nan
Session-4,T,I think youre the only one so far,127,0,nan
Session-4,T,Hes got his just fine,127,0,nan
Session-4,T,Most of you came up with this answer,127,0,nan
Session-4,T,Raise your hand if you got three and teneighths,127,1,nan
Session-4,T,All right that is technically right,127,0,nan
Session-4,T,You have three pounds plus ten more eighths pounds of ham slices however mathematically its inappropriate to have a mixed number wholes with fractions and your fraction be an improper fraction,127,0,nan
Session-4,T,Its just not the way that we do math in the world,127,0,nan
Session-4,T,Graham tell me what you wrote on your board,127,5,nan
Session-4,S,Four and twoeighths,127,nan,3
Session-4,T,Four and twoeighths,128,3,nan
Session-4,T,His answer looks really different from your answer but hes right,128,0,nan
Session-4,T,Because how many eights does it take to make one more full pound,128,5,nan
Session-4,T,Listen carefully how many eights does it take to make one more full pound,128,5,nan
Session-4,S,Eight eights,129,nan,3
Session-4,T,Eight eights,130,3,nan
Session-4,T,Eight eights equals one whole pound,130,0,nan
Session-4,T,If you take eight of those eight and bump it over its almost like when you have 13 you have three ones and one 10 but you cant put them in one column one place,130,0,nan
Session-4,T,You could bump those eight eights and make another whole one which makes it four but there are still twoeights of a pound sitting there,130,0,nan
Session-4,T,Nobody did it as an improper fraction as your answer,130,1,nan
Session-4,T,Not a single one of you,130,0,nan
Session-4,S,Im the only one that did that,131,nan,0
Session-4,T,Yes that I saw I dont know for a fact,132,0,nan
Session-4,T,Lets make this an improper fraction how many eighths is 1 whole,132,5,nan
Session-4,S,Eight,133,nan,3
Session-4,T,This right here is eighteighths plus another threeeighths,134,0,nan
Session-4,T,Hi Blake,134,0,nan
Session-4,T,We would have eighteighths plus another eighteighths when we have two whole ones,134,0,nan
Session-4,T,Whats eight plus eight,134,5,nan
Session-4,S,nan,135,nan,3
Session-4,T,16 eighths plus another seveneights,136,4,nan
Session-4,T,If you add all those eighths together anyone know what you get,136,5,nan
Session-4,T,16 17 18 19 plus 15 more whats 19 plus 15,137,5,nan
Session-4,S,34,138,nan,3
Session-4,T,I added 16 17 18 19 plus 15 more,139,0,nan
Session-4,T,Nobody did that but you could if it made sense in your brain,139,0,nan
Session-4,T,Ready to start practicing,139,1,nan
Session-4,T,Jeremy has a very important question for you all to hear can you repeat that very important question,140,1,nan
Session-4,S,Is it the wrong answer,141,nan,3
Session-4,T,If you write your mixed number your whole number with your fraction and this is bigger in value than this technically not the right way to do it,142,0,nan
Session-4,T,For today if thats the only way you can get there Im going to let that slide but we have to really work hard at knowing if I have ninefifths thats more than one whole thing how many of those fifths does it take to make another whole thing,142,5,nan
Session-4,S,Five,143,nan,3
Session-4,T,Five of them,144,4,nan
Session-4,T,I could take those fivefifths out and bump it over to my whole number bump my whole number up one,144,0,nan
Session-4,T,Its a lot like when youre adding normal numbers and you get to too many digits in the ones place you have to carry it over,144,0,nan
Session-4,T,If you have too many parts of a fraction you got to carry it over to become a whole number,144,0,nan
Session-4,T,All right look at your math journal page please,144,0,nan
Session-4,T,It is page number 162,144,0,nan
Session-4,T,We will work together to just get the first part started and then Ill let you work,145,0,nan
Session-4,T,Thank you Preston for being ready,145,0,nan
Session-4,T,Quick transition,145,0,nan
Session-4,T,Cooper can you please read number one this persons name is Balram,145,1,nan
Session-4,T,Balram,145,0,nan
Session-4,T,You just say B,145,0,nan
Session-4,S,Balram drew a line segment two and onefourth inches long then he made a line segment one and twofourths inches longer,145,nan,0
Session-4,S,How long is the line segment now,145,nan,0
Session-4,T,All right what is the whole thing were talking about,146,5,nan
Session-4,T,What measurement,146,5,nan
Session-4,S,Line segments,147,nan,3
Session-4,T,What is the whole,148,5,nan
Session-4,T,Think,148,0,nan
Session-4,T,Its one inch,148,0,nan
Session-4,T,One inch is the whole thing,148,0,nan
Session-4,T,Lets consider that whole,148,0,nan
Session-4,T,He drew two whole inches plus another fourth of an inch then he added on another whole inch plus twofourths of another inch on,148,0,nan
Session-4,T,Finn can you tell me what the number model with an unknown will look like,148,5,nan
Session-4,T,Equals,149,5,nan
Session-4,S,Question mark,150,nan,3
Session-4,T,You can do a letter or you doing question mark,151,1,nan
Session-4,S,Question mark,152,nan,3
Session-4,T,Question mark,153,3,nan
Session-4,T,You just have to decide one way if you would like to do adding your whole numbers first and then adding your fractions you may do that,153,0,nan
Session-4,T,If you would like to turn them all into improper fractions and then add to create an improper fraction you may do that,153,0,nan
Session-4,T,Notice what D says Kennedy what does D say,153,5,nan
Session-4,S,It says answer with unit,154,nan,3
Session-4,T,With unit that word needs to be at the end whatever your answer is needs to be labeled with,155,5,nan
Session-4,S,Inch,156,nan,3
Session-4,T,Inches,157,4,nan
Session-4,T,This ones an easy one because it turns out to be an okay mixed number,158,0,nan
Session-4,T,Ill get it,158,0,nan
Session-4,T,Im not going to give you the answer for that you guys are going to figure it out you are welcome to work with people at your tables today,158,0,nan
Session-4,T,Stay where you are,158,0,nan
Session-4,T,The microphones are there for your discussions to happen,158,0,nan
Session-4,T,Im turning mine off so that it can hear you go,158,0,nan
Session-4,T,You guys are not listening to directions,158,0,nan
Session-4,T,You guys heard me what did I say,158,1,nan
Session-4,S,To work with people at your table,158,nan,0
Session-4,T,At your tables,159,4,nan
Session-4,T,Work with people at your tables,159,0,nan
Session-4,T,So you can move around at your table but were not going off to different directions,159,0,nan
Session-4,T,Were sitting at our table,159,0,nan
Session-4,T,Well be done in about 16 minutes,160,0,nan
Session-4,S,What,160,nan,0
Session-4,S,Wait so 44 plus 44 plus 44 equals 164 plus 24 plus 14 equals 194,161,nan,4
Session-4,T,Times up,162,0,nan
Session-4,T,Two minutes,162,0,nan
Session-4,S,What,163,nan,0
Session-4,S,Oh yes,164,nan,0
Session-4,S,No it actually,165,nan,0
Session-4,S,I have it,166,nan,0
Session-4,S,I have it,166,nan,0
Session-4,S,You have to do the rule you cant do any more,167,nan,3
Session-4,S,Nathan youre doing it wrong,167,nan,1
Session-4,S,You have to do rule but you cant You have to do the rule,167,nan,3
Session-4,S,Yes ask her,167,nan,0
Session-4,S,She said you have to,167,nan,0
Session-4,S,I did the rule Tucker,168,nan,1
Session-4,S,LaLaLaLa LaLaLaLaLa,169,nan,0
Session-4,S,You dont know what 6  3 is,170,nan,1
Session-5,T,Okay lets get started,1,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay someone to tell me how do we write five tenths Regina,2,5,nan
Session-5,S,You write 05,3,nan,3
Session-5,T,Excellent,4,0,nan
Session-5,T,Nine tenths Rosa,4,5,nan
Session-5,S,9,5,nan,3
Session-5,T,Seven tenths Colt,6,5,nan

Session-5,T,Is that all right,10,1,nan
Session-5,T,Is it okay to have 070,10,1,nan
Session-5,S,Yes,11,nan,0
Session-5,T,23 hundredths Jasper what do you write,12,5,nan
Session-5,S,I wrote 023,13,nan,3
Session-5,T,Okay,14,0,nan
Session-5,T,How about three hundredths,14,5,nan
Session-5,T,Conrad what did you get,14,5,nan
Session-5,S,I wrote 003,15,nan,3
Session-5,T,Anyone write 03 for that,16,1,nan
Session-5,T,Darwin if we wrote 0,16,0,nan
Session-5,S,Wait hang on I meant Conrad was right,17,nan,1
Session-5,T,What,18,1,nan
Session-5,S,I meant Conrad is right,19,nan,1
Session-5,T,Oh that you were saying Conrad was right,20,2,nan

Session-5,T,Ruth what did you write,20,5,nan
Session-5,S,0 and,21,nan,3
Session-5,T,Thank you for saying the word and with your decimal because thats what it is,22,4,nan
Session-5,T,Alright quick maths of one and 19 hundredths Charlie what did you write,22,5,nan
Session-5,S,I wrote 1 and nine hundredths,23,nan,3
Session-5,T,You wrote nine hundredths,24,1,nan
Session-5,S,I wrote 0 and 9 hundredths,25,nan,3
Session-5,T,0 19 is that what you wrote,26,1,nan
Session-5,S,No without the one,27,nan,3
Session-5,T,Without the what,28,1,nan
Session-5,S,One,29,nan,3
Session-5,T,Without this one,30,1,nan
Session-5,S,Yes,31,nan,0
Session-5,T,You wrote 109,32,1,nan
Session-5,T,How can we fix this,32,5,nan
Session-5,T,Daxton,32,1,nan
Session-5,S,so it be 19 instead,33,nan,3
Session-5,T,Okay do you see where your mistake was,34,1,nan
Session-5,T,Alright eight and two tenths,34,0,nan
Session-5,T,Forest what did you write,34,5,nan
Session-5,S,I wrote 8 and 2,35,nan,3
Session-5,T,Alright,36,0,nan
Session-5,T,The last one 45 and eight hundredths,36,0,nan
Session-5,T,Kit what did you write,36,5,nan
Session-5,S,I wrote 450 and 8,37,nan,3
Session-5,T,Everybody agree,38,2,nan
Session-5,S,No,39,nan,1
Session-5,T,Why is it not 458,40,6,nan
Session-5,T,Darwins,40,1,nan
Session-5,S,It would then be tenths not hundredths,41,nan,3
Session-5,T,Okay,42,0,nan
Session-5,T,Remember that you want your numbers to match the columns,42,0,nan
Session-5,T,Each column and the place value chart has its own value,42,0,nan
Session-5,T,This is eight tenths this is eight hundredths,42,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay,42,0,nan
Session-5,T,Once you go further away from the decimal point,42,0,nan
Session-5,T,Good job you guysAlright looking at your math journal let me put this over we are comparing jugglers to tap dancers,42,0,nan
Session-5,S,We can see clearly,43,nan,0
Session-5,S,Oh pretty,45,nan,0
Session-5,T,All right how are you finding out the cost to hire jugglers,46,0,nan
Session-5,T,Tell me some math that you did there,46,0,nan
Session-5,T,Landon what math did you do to figure out how much jugglers cost,46,5,nan
Session-5,S,I did 3 x 30,47,nan,4
Session-5,S,Sorry I did 2 x 30 and I got 60,47,nan,4
Session-5,T,Can you tell me where you go those two numbers,48,5,nan
Session-5,S,I got 2 x 30 because two hours of entertainment x the cost per performer and then I did that I got 60,49,nan,4
Session-5,S,I did that x 3 which I got 180,49,nan,4
Session-5,T,Why did you do that x 3,50,6,nan
Session-5,S,Because there is three performers,51,nan,4
Session-5,T,Okay,52,0,nan
Session-5,T,In our message remember that it said dont forget thats the cost per performer,52,4,nan
Session-5,T,Good job remembering that you needed to do that for every performer,52,0,nan
Session-5,T,There were follow me,52,0,nan
Session-5,S,follow me call me,53,nan,0
Session-5,T,Okay,54,0,nan
Session-5,T,Landon said he did 2 x 30 because it was two hours of entertainment at 30 an hour and he got 60,54,0,nan
Session-5,T,Then he multiplied that x 3 because there were three performers,54,0,nan
Session-5,T,Did anyone do that in a different way,54,2,nan
Session-5,T,Grady how did you do yours,54,5,nan
Session-5,S,First I did 3 x 30 then I did 90 x 2,55,nan,4
Session-5,T,Okay so you did 30 an hour x the three performers and you got,56,5,nan
Session-5,S,90,57,nan,3
Session-5,T,90 and then you multiplied 90 x 2 because they did that for two hours,58,1,nan
Session-5,S,Yes,59,nan,0
Session-5,T,Excellent,60,0,nan
Session-5,T,Did you get 180,60,1,nan
Session-5,S,Yes,61,nan,0
Session-5,T,Does it matter what order you multiply this numbers in,62,1,nan
Session-5,S,No,63,nan,0
Session-5,T,As long as youre doing the correct multiplication,64,0,nan
Session-5,T,Are we doing three performers x two hours,64,1,nan
Session-5,S,No,65,nan,0
Session-5,T,Would it work,66,1,nan
Session-5,T,Whats 3 x 2,66,5,nan
Session-5,S,Six,67,nan,3
Session-5,T,Whats 6 x 30,68,5,nan
Session-5,S,180,69,nan,3
Session-5,T,Oh,70,0,nan
Session-5,T,6 x 30,70,0,nan
Session-5,T,Whats 6 x 3,70,5,nan
Session-5,S,180,71,nan,3
Session-5,T,So it would work,72,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay so that was for jugglers,73,0,nan
Session-5,T,Now we need to figure out for tap dancers,73,0,nan
Session-5,T,Someone give me Lee give me number model for tap dancers,73,5,nan
Session-5,S,33 x 4,73,nan,3
Session-5,T,Can you tell me why you did 33 x 2,74,6,nan
Session-5,S,I did for hours  the cost per performer,75,nan,3
Session-5,T,Oops you wrote the wrong thing,76,0,nan
Session-5,T,This is just the cost this is the hours,76,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay what did you get when you did 33 x 2,76,5,nan
Session-5,S,I got 66,77,nan,3
Session-5,T,Okay,78,0,nan
Session-5,S,Then I did 66 x 6 for the numbers of performers,79,nan,3
Session-5,T,Okay these are six tap dancers,80,1,nan
Session-5,S,Then I got 397,81,nan,3
Session-5,T,Anyone get a different answer or a different way of getting to the answer,82,2,nan
Session-5,T,Ruth can you talk me through what Lee just did,82,2,nan
Session-5,T,Can you repeat what she,82,1,nan
Session-5,S,33 x 2 66,83,nan,4
Session-5,T,Why did she do 33 x 2,84,2,nan
Session-5,T,To try and find,84,0,nan
Session-5,S,33 an hour,85,nan,3
Session-5,T,Okay and why did she do that x 2,86,2,nan
Session-5,S,for two hours,87,nan,3
Session-5,T,They are going to be there for two hours,88,4,nan
Session-5,T,Then why did she take that and multiply x 6,88,2,nan
Session-5,S,Because there was,89,nan,0
Session-5,T,They were six actual tap dancers okay,90,1,nan
Session-5,T,Now what do we do with that information,90,5,nan
Session-5,T,Our question asked us how much more would it cost to hire tap dancers than jugglers,90,0,nan
Session-5,T,What do we do now that we know how much it costs to have a tap dancer and how much it costs to have a juggler,90,5,nan
Session-5,T,Lou what do you do with those two numbers,90,5,nan
Session-5,S,You divide them,91,nan,3
Session-5,T,Divide them,92,1,nan
Session-5,T,Do you know how to do threedigit division done by threedigit division,92,1,nan
Session-5,T,I dont I do but I dont as a fourth grader,92,0,nan
Session-5,T,What do you do with those two totals,92,5,nan
Session-5,T,Hunter what are you going to do with them,92,5,nan
Session-5,S,Im going to look at the other number and try and compare how much more it has,93,nan,3
Session-5,T,When you hear how much more what do you think of in your head,94,5,nan
Session-5,S,I look at the costs of the bottom for tap dancingand its 396,95,nan,4
Session-5,S,Then I look at the six and theres six and then on top there is nine so that means it has more so I break down the six,95,nan,4
Session-5,T,Are you adding subtracting multiplying dividing what are you doing,96,5,nan
Session-5,S,So Im going to put all numbers that are higher how much is higher than the number,97,nan,4
Session-5,S,Then thats how much its more,97,nan,4
Session-5,T,Are you adding subtracting multiplying or dividing to figure out how much more,98,5,nan
Session-5,S,Dividing,99,nan,3
Session-5,T,Do you guys know how to do threedigit division by threedigit division,100,1,nan
Session-5,S,No,101,nan,0
Session-5,T,When you hear the words how much more,102,0,nan
Session-5,T,Kolton has nine years I have 45 years,102,0,nan
Session-5,T,How many more years do I have,102,5,nan
Session-5,T,How are we going to figure that out,102,5,nan
Session-5,T,Are you going to add multiply subtract divide,102,5,nan
Session-5,T,What are we going to do Conrad,102,5,nan
Session-5,S,Youre going to take two of those assignments and then youre going to subtract,103,nan,4
Session-5,S,Then soon when you have the answer then you write that down thats how much more,103,nan,4
Session-5,T,How much more those are clue words,104,4,nan
Session-5,T,When you subtract youre trying to find the difference between the two numbers,104,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay,104,0,nan
Session-5,T,Youre trying to find the difference,104,0,nan
Session-5,T,How much more clue word,104,0,nan
Session-5,T,Clue phrase I should say first subtracting,104,0,nan
Session-5,T,So Hunter you were telling me you wanted to find the bigger number to start with,104,0,nan
Session-5,T,I think thats what youre trying to explain is you knew 396 was more than 180 but were going to take that 180 away,104,0,nan
Session-5,T,If it costs 396 to hire tap dancers and 180 to hire jugglers theyre asking how much more would it cost to hire tap dancers than jugglers,104,0,nan
Session-5,T,When we subtract that what do we end up with Daxton,104,5,nan
Session-5,S,21600,105,nan,3
Session-5,T,Its 216 more to tire tap dancers than it is jugglers okay,106,1,nan
Session-5,T,Youre going to do lots of multistep not only without talent but also with food,106,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay so lets look through and read through the questions,107,0,nan
Session-5,T,You can you erase your whiteboard,107,0,nan
Session-5,T,Make sure your math journal is open,107,0,nan
Session-5,T,Thank you Silvia for being ready  for being ready,107,0,nan
Session-5,T,Thanks boys for being ready,107,0,nan
Session-5,T,All right the principal has several questions for Ian and Sarita about what they learned,107,0,nan
Session-5,T,Help them answer the principals questions,107,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay,107,0,nan
Session-5,T,Were going to do estimates as well,107,0,nan
Session-5,T,Were going to do this first one together and then Im going to see if you can help describe what we did,107,0,nan
Session-5,T,If you can ask questions to clarify if you are confused then Im going to have you solve one and explain to me how you did it and then Ill let you do the other one on your own,107,0,nan
Session-5,T,All right number one will you please read this to me Scarlet,107,1,nan
Session-5,T,How much more would it cost to hire the tumblers than the singing group,107,5,nan
Session-5,T,So what two groups are we comparing,108,5,nan
Session-5,S,Tumblers and singing group,109,nan,3
Session-5,T,Yes tumblers and singing group,110,4,nan
Session-5,T,So Im going to have to scooch that back down,110,0,nan
Session-5,T,Singers how much do they cost per hour,111,5,nan
Session-5,S,10800,111,nan,3
Session-5,T,16 an hour how long do they perform,112,5,nan
Session-5,S,Three hours,113,nan,3
Session-5,T,How many people are in their group,114,5,nan
Session-5,S,Four,115,nan,3
Session-5,T,Were going to do a number model with an unknown,116,0,nan
Session-5,T,What three numbers are we going to multiply together for the singing group,116,5,nan
Session-5,T,Frankie what three numbers do you think were going to multiply together for the singing group,117,5,nan
Session-5,S,30,117,nan,3
Session-5,T,Look at your chart carefully the singing group,118,0,nan
Session-5,S,16 four,119,nan,3
Session-5,T,Whered you get the four,120,5,nan
Session-5,S,Number of performers,121,nan,3
Session-5,T,Since there are four people in their group okay,122,1,nan
Session-5,T,Then what am I going to multiply that total by,122,5,nan
Session-5,S,Three,123,nan,3
Session-5,T,By three because,124,6,nan
Session-5,S,Hours of entertainment,125,nan,3
Session-5,T,they will perform for three hours okay,126,1,nan
Session-5,T,So thats one way to do it,126,0,nan
Session-5,T,Is there a different way to do it,126,2,nan
Session-5,T,Jasper whats a different way,126,2,nan
Session-5,S,You could do 4 x 3  12,127,nan,4
Session-5,S,Then you multiply 12 x 16,127,nan,4
Session-5,T,Okay,128,0,nan
Session-5,T,Is there even another way to do that,128,2,nan
Session-5,S,Yes,129,nan,0
Session-5,T,Lee what would be the third way,130,2,nan
Session-5,S,You could use 30 x 16 x 4,131,nan,3
Session-5,T,Yes,132,0,nan
Session-5,T,So were going to do an estimate,132,0,nan
Session-5,T,Whats an easier number to work with besides 16,132,5,nan
Session-5,S,20,133,nan,3
Session-5,T,20 is definitely easier,134,4,nan
Session-5,T,We know a very simple factor of 20 times four and then we can multiply that times three,134,0,nan
Session-5,T,What is 20 x 4,134,5,nan
Session-5,S,80,135,nan,3
Session-5,T,So that would be 80,136,4,nan
Session-5,T,Whats 80 times 3,136,5,nan
Session-5,S,200,137,nan,3
Session-5,T,Whats eight times three,138,5,nan
Session-5,S,24,139,nan,3
Session-5,T,24 but its not 24 ones its 24 tens so our answer should be close to 240 for the singing group,140,4,nan
Session-5,T,Okay thats only one part of our problem,140,0,nan
Session-5,T,We have to compare that to tumblers,140,0,nan
Session-5,T,Hunter how much do tumblers cost,140,5,nan
Session-5,S,Tumblers cost 22,141,nan,3
Session-5,T,22 an hour times how many hours,142,5,nan
Session-5,S,Times three,143,nan,3
Session-5,T,Then how many people are in their group,144,5,nan
Session-5,S,Eight,145,nan,3
Session-5,T,Times eight,146,4,nan
Session-5,T,Okay,146,0,nan
Session-5,T,So lets do an estimate for the tumblers,146,0,nan
Session-5,T,22 isnt as friendly a number as 20,146,0,nan
Session-5,T,We could do 20 X 3 we know that very easily,146,0,nan
Session-5,T,Whats that,146,5,nan
Session-5,S,60,147,nan,3
Session-5,T,Then we can multiply that times eight,148,0,nan
Session-5,T,We know our basic factor of six times eight,148,0,nan
Session-5,S,48,149,nan,3
Session-5,T,48 but its not 48 ones its 48 tens,150,4,nan
Session-5,T,Okay,150,0,nan
Session-5,T,So whos going to cost more,150,5,nan
Session-5,S,The tumblers,151,nan,3
Session-5,T,The tumblers,152,3,nan
Session-5,T,When we subtract were going to want to make sure that our tumblers number will come first because they will cost more,152,0,nan
Session-5,T,Are we subtracting our estimate,152,1,nan
Session-5,S,No,153,nan,0
Session-5,T,So our estimates going to be 480  240 which is 240,154,0,nan
Session-5,T,Because 24  24  48 but thats not what were looking for,154,0,nan
Session-5,T,Were looking for the real cost,154,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay,154,0,nan
Session-5,T,Anyone able to do 16 x 4 quickly,154,5,nan
Session-5,S,No,155,nan,0
Session-5,T,Hunter what is it,156,5,nan
Session-5,S,64,157,nan,3
Session-5,T,It is 64,158,4,nan
Session-5,T,Youre right good multiplication very quick,158,0,nan
Session-5,T,Are we done with singers,158,1,nan
Session-5,S,64 X 3,159,nan,3
Session-5,T,We have to do 64 x 3,160,4,nan
Session-5,T,Anyone able to do that quickly,160,5,nan
Session-5,T,Daxton,160,1,nan
Session-5,S,192,161,nan,3
Session-5,T,It is 192 is the total cost for singers,162,4,nan
Session-5,T,192 make sure we label,162,0,nan
Session-5,T,Lets figure out how much it is for tumblers,163,0,nan
Session-5,T,What s 22 x 3,163,5,nan
Session-5,S,66,164,nan,3
Session-5,T,Thats 66,165,4,nan
Session-5,T,We have to do that x 8,165,0,nan
Session-5,T,Anyone able to do 66 x 8 quickly,165,5,nan
Session-5,S,528,166,nan,3
Session-5,T,How much,167,5,nan
Session-5,S,528,168,nan,3
Session-5,T,You got it Daxton good multiplication,169,0,nan
Session-5,T,528,169,3,nan
Session-5,T,I may let you use calculators for the actual multiplication today since these are very big numbers,169,0,nan
Session-5,T,We have to find how much more it would cost to hire tumblers than the singing group,169,0,nan
Session-5,T,What are we going to start with,169,5,nan
Session-5,T,What are we going to do to find the answer to that,169,5,nan
Session-5,T,Cher do you know,169,1,nan
Session-5,T,How are we going to find the total cost or the total difference how much more it will cost,169,5,nan
Session-5,S,Subtraction,170,nan,3
Session-5,T,What am I going to start with,171,5,nan
Session-5,S,528,172,nan,3
Session-5,T,Im going to do 528 Im going to subtract,173,5,nan
Session-5,S,192,174,nan,3
Session-5,T,192,175,3,nan
Session-5,T,Come on mathematicians,175,0,nan
Session-5,S,897,176,nan,3
Session-5,T,How much more will it cost,177,5,nan
Session-5,T,Cher do you know it,178,1,nan
Session-5,S,333,179,nan,3
Session-5,T,Youre close,180,0,nan
Session-5,S,326,181,nan,3
Session-5,T,Collins say it,182,1,nan
Session-5,S,326,183,nan,3
Session-5,T,326 more to hire the tumblers than the singers,184,4,nan
Session-5,T,Raise your hand if you were able to at least follow the steps that we needed to do to get to our answers,185,1,nan
Session-5,T,You might need more time on the multiplication,185,0,nan
Session-5,T,We just had our quick multipliers help us out,185,0,nan
Session-5,T,Your job right now is to look at number two but now were moving to food,185,0,nan
Session-5,T,We are going to make your tummy growl,185,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay we are going to find out how much would it cost to buy the burritos and the sandwiches,185,0,nan
Session-5,T,When you hear the word and what are you doing,185,5,nan
Session-5,S,Addition,186,nan,3
Session-5,T,Youre adding,187,4,nan
Session-5,T,Youre going to add okay,187,1,nan
Session-5,T,Look at your chart notice that were going to do burritos there are eight burritos in a package youll need 13 packages and theyre 3 each,187,0,nan
Session-5,T,Same steps okay,187,1,nan
Session-5,T,Then the sandwiches are five per package you need 18 packages and theyre 6 each,187,0,nan
Session-5,T,You are going to solve number two in whatever steps make sense to you,187,0,nan
Session-5,T,When you are finished give me a thumbs up,187,1,nan
Session-5,T,You may start working on your math,187,0,nan
Session-5,T,You are going to have to explain to me how to go through this number two problem okay,187,1,nan
Session-5,T,Solve it when youre done thumbs up and you may flip and start working on,187,0,nan
Session-5,T,Were going to do number two and then Im going to let you work on number three and then try this in partners but because we are recording your mathematical thinking Im going to let you go through problem number two,187,0,nan
Session-5,T,See how you can solve it not how I can,187,0,nan
Session-5,T,If you need a calculator for the multiplication part but you have to show your work,187,0,nan
Session-5,T,You still have to know what steps to take and you have to show what youre doing,187,0,nan
Session-5,S,You can grab a calculator,188,nan,0
Session-5,S,I have a calculator,189,nan,0
Session-5,S,I already have a calculator,189,nan,0
Session-5,S,It doesnt turn off,189,nan,0
Session-5,S,Its on at all the times,189,nan,0
Session-5,S,Mine shuts off,190,nan,0
Session-5,S,You have to raise your hand,191,nan,0
Session-5,S,Show her how you finished,191,nan,0
Session-5,T,Thats the ones,192,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay Ill be waiting for you to explain,193,0,nan
Session-5,T,This is your 3 and this is your sandwiches but you only gave me your sandwiches total,194,0,nan
Session-5,S,Im sorry,195,nan,0
Session-5,T,Oh just kidding,196,0,nan
Session-5,T,Lets find,196,0,nan
Session-5,T,5  3 so how does your answer start with the  Make sure you put the label on it,196,0,nan
Session-5,T,What is that,196,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay Ill be ready for you there explain in just a few minutes,196,0,nan
Session-5,T,Alani youre welcome to start,197,0,nan
Session-5,T,Were on this oneThats how we are doing its just this problem tight here,198,0,nan
Session-5,T,You only have one thing here,198,0,nan
Session-5,T,Youre doing burritos and sandwiches,198,0,nan
Session-5,S,burritos 180,199,nan,3
Session-5,T,You multiplied 18 x 13 x 3,200,0,nan
Session-5,S,Im supposed to do eight in front,201,nan,3
Session-5,T,Yes,202,0,nan
Session-5,T,Thats what we were doing up here,202,0,nan
Session-5,T,You were playing attention and following well,202,0,nan
Session-5,T,You should have burritos and sandwiches Frank,203,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay keep doing your math boxes,203,0,nan
Session-5,T,Have you figured out your burritos,203,1,nan
Session-5,T,burritos  Do subtracting,203,1,nan
Session-5,S,No,204,nan,0
Session-5,T,Can you take a big number away from a small number to even begin with,205,1,nan
Session-5,S,No,206,nan,0
Session-5,T,Okay so think about what you need to do to,207,0,nan
Session-5,T,Make sure you have your dollar sign,207,0,nan
Session-5,T,That makes more sense,208,0,nan
Session-5,T,Put the dollar sign  and its dollars,208,0,nan
Session-5,T,Good Job,208,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay then make your box,208,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay  trying to  how you solve this,209,0,nan
Session-5,T,Those of you who are struggling through listen really carefully to your classmates and how they walk you through how to solve this,209,0,nan
Session-5,T,When youre explaining if I call on you please tell us why youre using specific numbers,209,0,nan
Session-5,T,If you say said I did 13 x 3 please tell me why you did 13 x 3,209,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay,209,0,nan
Session-5,T,Are you ready,209,1,nan
Session-5,T,Im going to turn my microphone off so that we can hear you not me,209,0,nan
Session-5,S,Miss  is trying to find you again,210,nan,0
Session-5,T,All right Lee,211,1,nan
Session-5,S,For the burritos I did should I start with my estimates or my,212,nan,3
Session-5,T,Lets do the actual number model first and then you could talk us through your estimates and then talk us through how you solved it,213,5,nan
Session-5,S,I wrote 13 x 3 because of the numbers of packages needed and the cost per item,214,nan,4
Session-5,T,Okay so they were 3 per,215,4,nan
Session-5,S,Yes,216,nan,0
Session-5,T,Then they were 13 per package,217,1,nan
Session-5,T,Is this burritos or sandwiches,217,1,nan
Session-5,S,Burritos,218,nan,3
Session-5,T,Okay,219,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay,219,0,nan
Session-5,T,Im going to put a little dollar sign right next to the three so that Ill remember that thats the money okay,219,1,nan
Session-5,T,What else did you do,219,5,nan
Session-5,S,Then you do x that you do x 8,220,nan,3
Session-5,T,Why,221,6,nan
Session-5,S,Because the numbers of pieces I get is per package,222,nan,4
Session-5,T,There are eight burritos in a package okay,223,1,nan
Session-5,S,Then from my estimate I did 10 x 3 because 10 was the  number,224,nan,4
Session-5,T,Okay,225,0,nan
Session-5,S,That,226,nan,0
Session-5,S,Lee So I did 10 x 3 is 30,227,nan,4
Session-5,S,I did that x 8  240,227,nan,4
Session-5,T,Burritos cost about 240 approximately,227,4,nan
Session-5,T,What did you do next,227,5,nan
Session-5,S,Then I went to sandwiches,228,nan,0
Session-5,S,I did 18 x 6 because of the number of packages needed and the cost per item,228,nan,4
Session-5,T,Okay so there were 18 sandwiches per package 6 each,229,4,nan
Session-5,S,I did that x 5,230,nan,3
Session-5,T,Because,231,6,nan
Session-5,S,Because of the items per package,232,nan,4
Session-5,T,Oh so we needed 18 packages theyre five sandwiches,233,4,nan
Session-5,S,Then from my estimate I did I rounded the 18 to 2020 x 6 then x 5,234,nan,4
Session-5,S,x 5  600,234,nan,4
Session-5,T,Its about 600 for sandwiches,235,4,nan
Session-5,T,Wow did you see that,235,0,nan
Session-5,T,My pen just randomly marked up there,235,0,nan
Session-5,T,Can you see that,235,0,nan
Session-5,S,Yes,236,nan,0
Session-5,S,There is a ghost in the house,237,nan,0
Session-5,T,Aliens in the classroom,238,0,nan
Session-5,T,Okay great,238,0,nan
Session-5,T,Were done with our estimate,238,0,nan
Session-5,T,Raise your hand if you did a different way of finding your estimate,238,0,nan
Session-5,T,Lillian how was estimate different,238,5,nan
Session-5,S,I did my estimate of doing 5 x 8,239,nan,3
Session-5,T,5 x 8,240,1,nan
Session-5,T,Where did you get five,240,5,nan
Session-5,S,I got the five from the three because it was close to five,241,nan,4
Session-5,T,Oh so youve rounded your three to be a five since it was a friendlier number,242,4,nan
Session-5,S,Then I did  x 13 and that equals the number of  Then with the sandwiches I did 5 x 5,243,nan,4
Session-5,T,You rounded your six to be a five instead,244,1,nan
Session-5,S,Yes,245,nan,0
Session-5,T,Then did that x 18,246,1,nan
Session-5,S,Yes,247,nan,0
Session-5,T,Okay,248,0,nan
Session-5,T,Did you come up with a very similar number if you add 600 and 240 together,248,1,nan
Session-5,S,Yes I got 840,249,nan,3
Session-5,T,We forgot that step didnt we Lee,250,1,nan
Session-5,T,We needed to add the cost of our sandwiches to the cost of our burritos,250,0,nan
Session-5,T,Really we would be doing 600  240  840 about,250,0,nan
Session-5,T,Jasper did you do something different,250,2,nan
Session-5,T,You had your hand up earlier for doing something different,250,0,nan
Session-5,T,Did you just do them in a different order,250,1,nan
Session-5,T,Three estimates,251,1,nan
Session-5,S,Mine was estimated but I did get the answer with that,252,nan,3
Session-5,T,You got something similar,253,2,nan
Session-5,S,From my own answer I got 852,254,nan,3
Session-5,T,We havent gone to the answer answer yet,255,0,nan
Session-5,T,Just for your estimate,255,0,nan
Session-5,S,Oh,256,nan,0
Session-5,T,Were simply doing estimates so far,257,0,nan
Session-5,T,Answer,257,0,nan
Session-5,T,Take your calculator push clear switch it on,257,0,nan
Session-5,T,Were going to follow these steps that Lillian gave us,257,0,nan
Session-5,T,Please type in 13 x 3 x 8,257,0,nan
Session-5,T,You should get 312 is that correct,257,1,nan
Session-5,S,Yes,258,nan,0
Session-5,T,Thats good,259,0,nan
Session-5,T,If we follow the steps that Lee gave us we are going to do 18 x 6 x 5 then push,259,0,nan
Session-5,S,540,260,nan,3
Session-5,S,540,261,nan,1
Session-5,T,You may keep your 540 there push  312,262,4,nan
Session-5,S,85200,263,nan,3
Session-5,S,85200,264,nan,1
Session-5,T,Was our estimate close to our total,265,1,nan
Session-5,S,Yes,266,nan,0
Session-5,T,Cool right,267,0,nan
Session-5,T,All right you may pick number three or number four to do with a partner,267,0,nan
Session-5,T,Then you are way above and beyond where you need to be in,267,0,nan
Session-5,T,If you decide to move make your microphone go with you somewhere,267,0,nan
Session-5,T,You need to do problem three or four with a partner,268,0,nan
Session-5,T,Calculators are fine,268,0,nan
Session-5,S,Wait do we take the microphone,269,nan,0
Session-5,T,Only if youre going to work somewhere else,270,0,nan
Session-5,S,Oh okay,271,nan,0
Session-5,S,Come on Collin,271,nan,0
Session-5,S,You want to go,271,nan,0
Session-5,S,Yes lets go to my chair,272,nan,0
Session-5,S,Daxton do you want toYou want to work somewhere else,273,nan,0
Session-5,S,No yes,274,nan,0
Session-5,S,Cut between,275,nan,0
Session-5,S,Lets do it,276,nan,0
Session-5,T,1,277,0,nan
Session-5,S,Lets turn to the page its 188,278,nan,0
Session-5,S,So should we do three or four,279,nan,0
Session-5,S,If you wanted the tap dancers,280,nan,0
Session-5,S,It doesnt matter lets just do one,281,nan,0
Session-5,S,No lets just do four,282,nan,0
Session-5,S,If we wanted tap dancers to perform for six hours how much would it cost,282,nan,2
Session-5,S,Wait tap dancers lets look at the chart,282,nan,0
Session-5,S,Theyre six oh I get it you need to multiply 2 by 3,282,nan,3
Session-5,S,Im literally doing,282,nan,0
Session-5,S,with that cost so you would have to be  You have to do this,283,nan,3
Session-5,S,I know but there is 33 in there,284,nan,1
Session-5,S,Youd have to double that,285,nan,1
Session-5,S,That is the tap dancers at the bottom,286,nan,0
Session-5,S,We have changed that to this,287,nan,0
Session-5,S,Okay math boxes,288,nan,0
Session-5,S,Lets do,289,nan,0
Session-5,S,The estimates,290,nan,2
Session-5,S,I already did,291,nan,0
Session-5,S,Yes,292,nan,0
Session-5,S,That is 360,292,nan,3
Session-5,S,Next problem is if we wanted to serve only burritos youd need three times as many packages as the numbers indicated in the table,292,nan,0
Session-5,S,How much would that cost,292,nan,0
Session-5,S,Its division,293,nan,3
Session-5,S,If we wanted to serve only burritos we would need three times as many packages as the numbers stated in the table,294,nan,4
Session-5,S,How much would that cost,294,nan,2
Session-5,S,If we wanted to serve only burritos we would need three times as many packages as the number stated on the table so the number stated on the table is 13,294,nan,4
Session-5,S,We do  x 3,294,nan,3
Session-5,S,We do that on the calculator that would be 13 x 3 x 3  117,294,nan,4
Session-5,S,Hold on we have to do the number model with that number,295,nan,3
Session-5,S,Why dont we just we do this without the answers then we come to write the answers from all these,296,nan,3
Session-5,S,Yes youre right,297,nan,0
Session-5,S,Which angle shows W X Y,298,nan,2
Session-5,S,I dont do this,298,nan,0
Session-5,T,How many of you are doing problem number four,299,1,nan
Session-5,S,Already did,300,nan,0
Session-5,T,Dont forget you have the total cost for burritos on problem number two,301,0,nan
Session-5,T,You can rewrite that then do a 3,301,0,nan
Session-5,S,To try this is also known as number five if we added all the performers and wanted to give them each a sandwich as a snack how many packages of sandwiches would we need for the performers,302,nan,0
Session-5,S,If they hired all the performers that would mean you would do 3  4  8  6 which is 21,302,nan,4
Session-5,S,That would 21,302,nan,4
Session-5,S,There are 35 colored pencils in a basket,303,nan,0
Session-5,S,There are 35 colored pencils in a basket 13 in a box,303,nan,0
Session-5,S,How many will each one get,303,nan,0
Session-5,S,Wait we dont know what were using,303,nan,0
Session-5,S,Oh whats 35  13,303,nan,2
Session-5,S,Ms Glen do you have to do this try this,303,nan,0
Session-5,S,So we need to do 3   3,303,nan,3
Session-5,T,Two more minutes,304,0,nan
Session-5,S,Oh no,305,nan,0
Session-5,S,Wait,305,nan,0
Session-5,S,Equals eight,305,nan,3
Session-5,S,Oh zero,305,nan,3
Session-5,S,Yes the next one is zero,306,nan,1
Session-5,S,Yes but thats  8 x 5  that,307,nan,3
Session-5,S,Its 1   8,308,nan,3
Session-5,S,Do that on your calculator 1   8,308,nan,3
Session-5,T,They want him to perform for six hours and normally they perform for two hours,309,0,nan
Session-5,S,Wait I know what to do with this,310,nan,0
Session-5,S,Its 36,310,nan,3
Session-5,S,We can do this though this may take a little bit of time,311,nan,0
Session-5,S,We can do 8 x 13 which is 104 x 3  312 then we do the 32,311,nan,4
Session-5,S,Okay,312,nan,0
Session-5,S,Oh wait no we need to find 36 on the board,312,nan,3
Session-5,S,No yes,312,nan,1
Session-5,S,8 x 13  104,313,nan,4

Session-5,S,104 x 3  312 x 3  936,314,nan,4
Session-5,S,Oh wait wait stop I think I know if we do like this its one,315,nan,0
Session-5,S,Its one it has to be,315,nan,3
Session-5,S,I know,315,nan,1
Session-5,S,Ill go get my calculator,316,nan,0
Session-5,S,Can you put my calculator on,317,nan,0
Session-5,T,All right guys,318,0,nan
Session-5,T,Thank you for,318,0,nan
Session-5,S,Yes,319,nan,0
Session-5,S,I wrote 33 x 6 because it says that they wanted for the 6 it says they wanted 6 and 32 from the tap dancers,319,nan,4
Session-5,S,I made that second to the two,319,nan,4
Session-5,S,I put 33 because it costs 33 per hour,319,nan,4
Session-5,S,Then I found that,319,nan,4
Session-5,S,I cant remember how much that was and then I,319,nan,4
Session-5,T,Get the calculator someone Andy,320,0,nan
Session-5,T,33 x 6,320,5,nan
Session-5,S,198,321,nan,3
Session-5,S,198 then I did times 6 again and then I,322,nan,4
Session-5,T,Why did you pick another six,323,6,nan
Session-5,S,Because there are six numbers of performance six people in it,324,nan,4
Session-5,S,Theyre now equal 1188,324,nan,4
Session-5,T,People dollars what do you use,325,5,nan
Session-5,S,Dollars,326,nan,3
Session-5,T,You dont have to do,327,0,nan
Session-5,S,Okay,328,nan,0
Session-5,T,If you did number three doublecheck your work,329,0,nan
Session-5,T,Any questions on that,329,1,nan
Session-5,T,Cecilia thank you for telling why you used those numbers for each person,329,0,nan
Session-5,T,Number four,329,0,nan
Session-5,T,Jasper you have to be a little patient,329,0,nan
Session-5,S,Erase all these,330,nan,0

Session-5,S,Thank you Cecilia,332,nan,0
Session-5,T,All right Jasper,333,0,nan
Session-5,T,All right if we only wanted to serve burrito we would need three times as many packages as the numbers we have on the table,333,0,nan
Session-5,T,Tell me what you did for your unknown,333,0,nan
Session-5,S,The unknown that we did mean that the 312 x 3,334,nan,3
Session-5,T,Where did you get 312,335,5,nan
Session-5,S,I got 312 by how much I remembered,336,nan,3
Session-5,T,From problem what,337,5,nan
Session-5,S,Number two,338,nan,3
Session-5,T,From problem number two we already found out how much burrito cost right,339,1,nan
Session-5,T,We knew 312 was the cost of burritos but then why did you use times three,339,6,nan
Session-5,S,Because it said we would need three different people to have this,340,nan,4
Session-5,T,Its 300 x 3,341,4,nan
Session-5,S,It will be,342,nan,0
Session-5,T,how did he go,343,0,nan
Session-5,T,Whats 300 x 3,343,5,nan
Session-5,S,300 x 3 is 900,344,nan,4
Session-5,T,Whats 10 x 3,345,5,nan
Session-5,S,10 x 3 is 30,346,nan,4
