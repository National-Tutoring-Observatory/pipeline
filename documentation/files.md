# Files

## Overview

**Files** are the raw, imported tutoring data you upload to the NTO Pipeline. These are typically transcripts or other forms of text-based data from your research. Upon upload, the application automatically processes each file, breaking it down into one or more **Sessions** for individual analysis.

Files serve as the source material for all analysis within a **Project**.

## How to use

The primary way to interact with files is through the import process.

1.  **Import a New File:** Navigate to a **Project** and locate the "Import Data" or "Upload Files" section.
2.  **Select and Upload:** Select the tutoring data file from your computer and upload it. The NTO Pipeline will begin processing the file.
3.  **Check Status:** You can monitor the status of the import process. Once complete, the file will be broken down into individual **Sessions** that are ready for a **Run**.
