# Projects

## Overview

A **Project** is the highest level of organization in the NTO Pipeline. It acts as a central folder or workspace where you can store and manage all the components related to a specific research initiative or task. This includes your raw tutoring data (**Sessions** and **Files**), the **Prompts** you've created, and the results of your analysis (**Runs**).

Using a project allows you to keep all related work together, ensuring a clear and organized workflow. Projects can be co-owned by multiple **Teams**, which facilitates easy collaboration and sharing of resources among colleagues.

## How to use

The process of using projects in the NTO Pipeline involves creating a new project, adding your data and prompts, and then running your analysis within that project.

1.  **Creating a Project:** Navigate to the "Projects" section of the app and click the "New Project" button. Give your project a clear, descriptive name.
2.  **Adding Resources:** Once the project is created, you can begin adding resources to it. This includes importing your tutoring data files and creating or importing new prompts.
3.  **Initiating a Run:** Inside your project, you can select the sessions and prompts you wish to analyze and initiate a new **Run**.
4.  **Viewing and Exporting Results:** After a run is complete, you can view the results and download the annotated data directly from the project dashboard.
