**Teams** are groups of **Users** who collaborate on projects. Being a member of a team allows for seamless sharing of resources, including **Prompts** and **Runs**, with other team members. This is designed to facilitate collaboration on shared research goals and to ensure consistency across a group's work.

Users can be a part of multiple teams, allowing for participation in various collaborative efforts.

#### How to use

Team management is handled through a dedicated settings section.

1.  **Create a Team:** Navigate to your account settings or a dedicated "Teams" page to create a new team.
2.  **Invite Members:** Invite other **Users** to join your team using their email address.
3.  **Share Projects:** Once a team is created, you can grant the team co-ownership of a **Project**. This allows all team members to access and work on that project's files, prompts, and runs.
