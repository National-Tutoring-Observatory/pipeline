### Dashboard

The **Dashboard** is your personal home page in the NTO Pipeline. It's designed to give you a quick, at-a-glance overview of your recent activity and the status of your data. Think of it as a control panel where you can monitor your progress.

From here, you can see a summary of your most recent **Runs**, including their completion status and key analytics. It's the primary location for you to track ongoing work and quickly access the results of your analyses.

#### How to use

The dashboard is your starting point for monitoring activity and accessing results.

1.  **View Recent Runs:** When you log in, the dashboard will display a list of your most recent runs. You can check the status of a run (e.g., pending, in progress, complete) without having to navigate into a specific **Project**.
2.  **Access Analytics:** The dashboard provides high-level analytics for your runs, such as the number of **Annotations** created. This helps you quickly assess the output of your analysis.
3.  **Download Data:** For completed runs, the dashboard provides a direct link to download the annotated data in formats like CSV and JSON.
