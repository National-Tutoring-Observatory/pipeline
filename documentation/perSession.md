# Per session

## Overview

**Per session** is an **Annotation Type** that instructs the LLM to analyze your tutoring data as a complete whole. This approach is best for identifying overarching themes or summary-level information about a **Session**.

When you choose this type, the LLM will read the entire transcript of a session and produce a single **Annotation** that summarizes the content based on your **Prompt**'s instructions.

## How to use

You select "Per session" when you set up a **Run**.

1.  **Start a New Run:** Begin the run configuration process.
2.  **Select Annotation Type:** From the "Annotation Type" dropdown menu, choose "Per session."
3.  **Finalize Run:** Complete the rest of your run configuration by selecting your **Prompt** and **Sessions** before starting the analysis.
