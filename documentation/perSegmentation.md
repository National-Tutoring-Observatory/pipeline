### Per segmentation

**Per segmentation** is a planned **Annotation Type** that will provide an additional, more granular level of analysis. It will instruct the LLM to analyze your tutoring data based on user-defined segments within a **Session**.

This will be a step between **Per annotation** (line-by-line) and **Per session** (whole session), allowing for analysis on specific turns, topics, or sections of the transcript.

#### How to use

_Note: This feature is not yet implemented._

When it becomes available, you will use it when you set up a **Run**.

1.  **Start a New Run:** Begin the run configuration process.
2.  **Select Annotation Type:** From the "Annotation Type" dropdown menu, choose "Per segmentation."
3.  **Finalize Run:** Complete the rest of your run configuration by selecting your **Prompt** and **Sessions** before starting the analysis.
