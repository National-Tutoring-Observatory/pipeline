# Per annotation

## Overview

**Per annotation** is an **Annotation Type** that instructs the LLM to analyze your tutoring data on a line-by-line basis. This is a fine-grained approach that is best for identifying specific actions or events that occur at a precise moment in a **Session**.

When you choose this type, the LLM will read each individual line of a transcript and create a separate **Annotation** for it based on your **Prompt**'s instructions.

## How to use

You select "Per annotation" when you set up a **Run**.

1.  **Start a New Run:** Begin the run configuration process.
2.  **Select Annotation Type:** From the "Annotation Type" dropdown menu, choose "Per annotation."
3.  **Finalize Run:** Complete the rest of your run configuration by selecting your **Prompt** and **Sessions** before starting the analysis.
