A **Session** is the primary unit of tutoring data that the LLM analyzes. A single imported **File** may contain one or multiple sessions, depending on its structure. Each session represents a distinct tutoring interaction and can be selected individually for a **Run**.

Sessions are the building blocks of your analysis, as they are the pieces of data that the **Prompt** is applied to.

#### How to use

Sessions are created automatically when you upload a **File**.

1.  **Import a File:** Upload a new tutoring data file to a **Project**.
2.  **View Sessions:** Once the file is processed, you can view the individual sessions that were created. They will be listed within the project's data section.
3.  **Select for a Run:** When you configure a new **Run**, you will choose which of these sessions to include in the analysis.
