# Prompts

## Overview

A **Prompt** is the set of instructions you give to the LLM. It is the central element that tells the LLM exactly what to look for and how to create **Annotations** from your tutoring data. A well-written prompt is crucial for getting accurate and useful results.

You can create prompts to find a wide variety of patterns in your data, from identifying instances of specific teacher praise to recognizing moments of student confusion. **Prompt versions** allow you to refine and improve your instructions over time.

## How to use

You will create and manage prompts within a **Project**.

1.  **Create a New Prompt:** Within a project, navigate to the "Prompts" section and click "Create New Prompt."
2.  **Write Your Instructions:** Write clear and specific instructions for the LLM. You can provide examples to help the model understand your goal.
3.  **Save and Version:** Save your prompt. Any time you make an edit, a new **Prompt version** is automatically created.
4.  **Select for a Run:** When you are ready to analyze your data, you will select the desired prompt and **Prompt version** to use in a **Run**.
