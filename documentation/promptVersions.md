# Prompt versions

## Overview

**Prompt versions** are different iterations of a single **Prompt**. As you refine a prompt to improve its performance or change its focus, a new version is created. This allows you to track changes, revert to previous versions if needed, and compare the results of different versions.

You can also designate a specific version as the "production" version, which serves as the recommended or default prompt to use for a **Run**.

## How to use

Prompt versions are managed automatically by the system, but you can interact with them to compare or select a preferred version.

1.  **Edit a Prompt:** To create a new version, simply edit and save an existing **Prompt**. A new version will be saved in the prompt's history.
2.  **Select a Production Version:** From the prompt's detail page, you can designate one of the versions as "production." This is a helpful way to signal to your **Team** which version is the most reliable.
3.  **Choose for a Run:** When you configure a **Run**, you will have the option to choose from any of the available prompt versions.
